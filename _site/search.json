The original formulation by Mader and Heck (1986) expressed glycolytic activity as a function of ADP concentration:\n\\[\nvLa_{ss} = \\frac{vLa_{max}}{1 + \\frac{ks_2}{[ADP]^3}}\n\\tag{9}\\]\nWhere [ADP] represents the concentration of adenosine diphosphate, which reflects the energy state of the muscle cell. However, measuring [ADP] directly is impractical in applied settings. The ingenious solution was to express [ADP] in terms of measurable parameters related to oxygen uptake.\nThe relationship between oxidative phosphorylation and [ADP] follows a similar Michaelis-Menten pattern:\n\\[\n\\dot{V}O_{2ss} = \\frac{\\dot{V}O_{2max}}{1 + \\frac{ks_1}{[ADP]^2}}\n\\tag{10}\\]\nThrough algebraic manipulation, this equation can be rearranged to express [ADP] in terms of oxygen uptake:\n\\[\n[ADP]^2 = \\frac{ks_1 \\cdot \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}{\\dot{V}O_{2max} - \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}\n\\tag{11}\\]\nTherefore:\n\\[\n[ADP] = \\left(\\frac{ks_1 \\cdot \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}{\\dot{V}O_{2max} - \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}\\right)^{1/2}\n\\tag{12}\\]\nSubstituting this expression into the original equation for \\(vLa_{ss}\\) and raising both sides to appropriate powers:\n\\[\n[ADP]^3 = \\left(\\frac{ks_1 \\cdot \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}{\\dot{V}O_{2max} - \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}\\right)^{3/2}\n\\tag{13}\\]\nThis leads to the final formulation:\n\\[\nvLa_{ss} = \\frac{vLa_{max}}{1 + ks_2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\dot{V}O_{2max} - \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}{ks_1 \\cdot \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}\\right)^{3/2}}\n\\tag{14}\\]\nThis equation elegantly connects glycolytic activity to oxygen uptake parameters, enabling practical application of the model using standard physiological measurements. The exponent 3/2 arises directly from the combination of the squared relationship between oxygen uptake and [ADP] (exponent 1/2) and the cubed relationship between glycolysis and [ADP] (exponent 3).\nInterestingly, in some literature, particularly in running applications Ji et al. (2021), the equation appears with an exponent of 3 rather than 3/2 due to a different algebraic arrangement of the terms. However, both formulations are mathematically equivalent and describe the same physiological relationship.\nThe term \\(\\left(\\frac{\\dot{V}O_{2max} - \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}{ks_1 \\cdot \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}\\right)^{3/2}\\) represents the phosphorylation state of the muscle cell, which regulates glycolytic flux. As exercise intensity increases and \\(\\dot{V}O_{2ss}\\) approaches \\(\\dot{V}O_{2max}\\), this term decreases, resulting in increased glycolytic activity.\nIn the application, this calculation is performed for each power value in the range from 0 W up to approximately 125% of the estimated maximum aerobic power. The constants ks1 and ks2 are hard-coded, while vLamax is adjustable through a slider control, allowing users to simulate different glycolytic capacities.\nDunst et al. (2025) found that while \\(vLa_{max}\\) appeared to increase with cycling cadence in a polynomial relationship, this may be an artifact of measurement methodology rather than representing true changes in maximal glycolytic flux. Their findings suggest that \\(vLa_{max}\\) should be treated as cadence-independent for modeling purposes.\nIn the application, \\(vLa_{ss}\\) is converted to mmol·l\\(^{-1}\\)·min\\(^{-1}\\) for visualization purposes:\n\\[\nvLa_{ss} \\text{ [mmol·l}^{-1}\\text{·min}^{-1}\\text{]} = vLa_{ss} \\text{ [mmol·l}^{-1}\\text{·s}^{-1}\\text{]} \\cdot 60\n\\tag{15}\\]"

The app displays power output-specific values for \\(\\dot{V}O_{2ss}\\), \\(vLa_{ss}\\), \\(vLa_{ox}\\), PD, and lactate accumulation, providing insights into the metabolic profile at different intensities.\nIn the first tab, the application calculates and displays detailed metabolic values for three key points: 1. FATmax: The power output with maximum fat oxidation potential 2. MLSS: The highest sustainable power without progressive lactate accumulation 3. BLC ≈ 4.0: The power output corresponding to a blood lactate of approximately 4 mmol/l\nFor each of these points, the text output area shows: - The exact power output (in watts or W/kg) - The corresponding VO2 value (in ml/min or ml/kg/min) - The lactate production rate (vLass) - The lactate elimination rate (vLaox) - The pyruvate deficit (PD) - The accumulated blood lactate\nThese detailed quantitative outputs enable precise training prescription and performance prediction based on individual physiological profiles.\nFor training prescription, the identification of FATmax and MLSS is particularly valuable, as these thresholds demarcate important training zones. The ability to account for cadence effects enhances the precision of these prescriptions, especially for cyclists who may use different cadences during training and competition.\nAs highlighted by Dunst et al. (2025), neglecting movement velocity in metabolic modeling can lead to significant errors in performance predictions, with deviations of up to 100W in threshold power estimates. By incorporating cadence-dependent relationships, the application provides a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between movement velocity and metabolic processes, enhancing the utility of Mader’s model for endurance performance prediction and training optimization.\nRecent critical analysis by Nolte et al. (2022) cautions against over-reliance on the model’s quantitative predictions without careful validation. Their findings suggest that while the model provides valuable qualitative insights into metabolic processes, individual variations in lactate removal capabilities and potential limitations in vLamax measurement protocols may affect the accuracy of threshold predictions. Users should therefore interpret the model outputs as one component of a comprehensive assessment rather than as definitive values.\nNevertheless, the model’s ability to simulate how different combinations of aerobic and anaerobic capacities can produce similar performance outcomes offers unique insights for training prescription. As Ji et al. (2021) demonstrated, the model can help identify specific physiological limitations (aerobic capacity, glycolytic capacity, or movement economy) that may be limiting an athlete’s performance, allowing for more targeted training interventions.\n\nBerechnung der Substratverteilung\nBeschrieben in Heck et al.

This simulation extends the steady-state calculations to account for the temporal dynamics of physiological adaptation during exercise.\n\nTime-Dependent VO₂ Kinetics\nWhile the first tab focuses on steady-state relationships, the exercise simulation incorporates time constants to model the delay in oxygen uptake response to changes in exercise intensity:\n\\[\n\\dot{V}O_2(t) = \\dot{V}O_2(t-1) + (\\dot{V}O_{2ss} - \\dot{V}O_2(t-1)) \\cdot (1 - e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau})\n\\tag{25}\\]\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_2(t)\\) is the actual oxygen uptake at time \\(t\\)\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2ss}\\) is the steady-state oxygen uptake for the current power output\n\\(\\Delta t\\) is the time step (typically 1 second in the simulation)\n\\(\\tau\\) is the time constant, which can differ for increases (\\(\\tau_{up}\\)) and decreases (\\(\\tau_{down}\\)) in intensity\n\nThis mono-exponential model accounts for the delayed response of oxidative metabolism to changes in power output, which significantly affects metabolic responses during interval training or variable-intensity exercise.\nIn the application, users can adjust both the upward and downward time constants through slider controls. This allows for exploration of how different VO2 kinetics profiles affect metabolic responses. The simulation applies these time constants to calculate the actual VO2 value for each second of the exercise bout, starting from the resting VO2 value.\n\n\nDynamic Lactate Modeling\nThe simulation calculates instantaneous rates of lactate production and elimination based on the actual (not steady-state) oxygen uptake at each time point:\n\nLactate production (\\(vLa_{ss}\\)) is calculated using the equation #eq-vLass but with the actual \\(\\dot{V}O_2(t)\\) rather than \\(\\dot{V}O_{2ss}\\). This is a critical distinction, as it accounts for the delayed VO2 response during transitions in exercise intensity.\nLactate elimination incorporates concentration-dependent kinetics:\n\n\\[\nvLa_{ox}(t) = \\frac{CE_{La\\dot{O}_2} \\cdot \\dot{V}O_2(t)}{VolLa \\cdot 60} \\cdot \\min(La(t-1), 15) / 8\n\\tag{26}\\]\nWhere \\(La(t-1)\\) is the blood lactate concentration from the previous time step. The factor \\(\\min(La(t-1), 15) / 8\\) represents the saturation of lactate transporters at higher concentrations, with maximal transport occurring around 8 mmol·l⁻¹ and diminishing returns beyond 15 mmol·l⁻¹.\nThis concentration-dependent modification is an important advancement beyond the steady-state model, as it more realistically represents how lactate clearance increases with elevated blood lactate levels. The application applies this enhanced equation for each time point in the simulation.\n\nThe change in blood lactate concentration is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta La(t) = (vLa_{ss}(t) - vLa_{ox}(t)) \\cdot \\Delta t\n\\tag{27}\\]\nThis equation is applied for each time step to determine how much lactate is added to or removed from the blood.\n\nBlood lactate concentration is updated while ensuring it doesn’t fall below baseline:\n\n\\[\nLa(t) = \\max(La_{base}, La(t-1) + \\Delta La(t))\n\\tag{28}\\]\nThe baseline lactate value is user-adjustable through the “Ruhelaktat” slider, allowing simulation of different resting conditions. The application ensures that calculated lactate never falls below this baseline, reflecting the physiological reality that basal metabolism maintains a minimum lactate level."

The model uniquely incorporates both maximal aerobic capacity (\\(\\dot{V}O_{2max}\\)) and maximal glycolytic rate (\\(vLa_{max}\\)) to simulate the dynamic interplay between oxidative and glycolytic energy systems during exercise.\nThe fundamental strength of Mader’s approach lies in its physiological basis, describing metabolic processes through Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics that reflect the activation of energy systems as functions of the cytosolic phosphorylation state. This allows for a mechanistically sound prediction of key performance indicators like Maximal Lactate Steady State (MLSS) and peak fat oxidation (FAT\\(_{max}\\)), offering insights that go beyond empirical threshold concepts.\nIn recent years, researchers have extended the application of this model from cycling to running, validating its transferability across exercise modalities.

    "text": "Sport-Specific Adaptations: Cycling vs. Running\nWhile Mader’s model maintains its fundamental structure across different exercise modalities, several important adaptations are necessary when transferring between cycling and running applications:\n\nIntensity Measurement: In cycling, power output (Watts) serves as the primary intensity metric, offering a direct measure of mechanical work. In contrast, running utilizes velocity (m·s\\(^{-1}\\)) as the intensity parameter, which introduces additional complexities related to terrain, body mass, and running economy.\nOxygen Demand Relationship: For cycling, oxygen demand is typically expressed relative to power output using the constant \\(CE_{V\\dot{O}_2}\\) (ml·min\\(^{-1}\\)·W\\(^{-1}\\)). In running models, this relationship is captured by the parameter Ks4, representing oxygen demand per unit of running velocity (ml·kg\\(^{-1}\\)·min\\(^{-1}\\) per m·s\\(^{-1}\\)).\nEconomy Considerations: Running economy demonstrates greater inter-individual variation than cycling economy due to its weight-bearing nature and the influence of biomechanical factors. Consequently, running models require individual determination of Ks4 through empirical testing, whereas cycling models traditionally used a standardized \\(CE_{V\\dot{O}_2}\\) value across subjects.\nMass-Specific Values: Running calculations typically employ mass-specific values (ml·kg\\(^{-1}\\)·min\\(^{-1}\\)) for oxygen uptake, while cycling calculations often use absolute values (ml·min\\(^{-1}\\)), though weight-normalized values (W·kg\\(^{-1}\\)) are increasingly common for power measurements in cycling.\nModel Validation: The validity of Mader’s model appears to vary between cycling and running. Nolte et al. (2022) found that for both modalities, experimental data showed significant deviations from model predictions, with running data requiring a significantly higher lactate removal constant (\\(k_{re}\\) of 0.1347 vs. 0.0533 mmol·kg·l⁻¹·ml⁻¹ for cycling) to achieve reasonable fit. These findings suggest that fundamental differences in muscle recruitment patterns, blood flow dynamics, and lactate kinetics between running and cycling may not be fully captured by the current model.\nMeasurement Protocols: The procedures for determining vLamax differ between cycling (typically short isokinetic sprints) and running (fixed-distance sprints), potentially introducing methodological biases. Ji et al. (2021) highlighted the need for developing running-specific vLamax assessment protocols to improve the accuracy of the model in running applications.\n\nRecent research by Dunst et al. (2025) has further highlighted the importance of considering movement velocity (cadence in cycling) when applying these models, demonstrating that neglecting this factor can lead to significant errors in threshold power estimates."

This formulation places the exponents on the entire fraction rather than just the numerator of the ADP-dependent term, which Nolte argues is more mathematically appropriate as it ensures the argument of the power function remains dimensionless.\nThrough algebraic manipulation, Nolte derives a relationship between normalized net lactate accumulation and normalized oxygen uptake:\n\\[\n\\%\\dot{c}La_{net}= \\left(1+\\left(\\frac{K_{La}}{K_{ox}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1-\\%\\dot{V}O_2}{\\%\\dot{V}O_2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n_{ox}}}\\right)^{n_{La}}\\right)^{-1} - \\left(\\frac{\\dot{V}O_{2,max}}{\\dot{c}La_{max}}\\right) \\cdot k_{re} \\cdot \\%\\dot{V}O_2\n\\tag{31}\\]\nThis equation reveals that \\(\\%\\dot{c}La_{net}\\) is determined by the difference between a nonlinear term (glycolytic activity) and a linear term (lactate removal). Setting \\(\\%\\dot{c}La_{net}\\) to zero (the condition at MLSS) yields an equation that can only be solved numerically but demonstrates the unique dependence of \\(\\%\\dot{V}O_2\\) at MLSS on the ratio \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}/\\dot{c}La_{max}\\).\n\nExercise Termination Criteria\nThe simulation incorporates a lactate-based termination criterion, where exercise is considered to end when blood lactate concentration reaches a user-specified maximum value (\\(La_{max}\\)):\n\\[\n\\text{Terminate if } La(t) \\geq La_{max}\n\\tag{32}\\]\nThis simulates the physiological limitation imposed by severe acidosis during high-intensity exercise.\nIn the application, users can adjust this termination criterion through the “Laktat-Abbruchkriterium” slider. When the simulated blood lactate reaches this threshold, the application identifies the time point and corresponding power output, then truncates all data series at this point. This termination point is marked in the visualization with a vertical line and labeled with the corresponding power output.\n\n\nHandling Variable Power Profiles\nThe application supports three methods for defining power profiles:\n\nStep test simulation: Automatically generates a ramp protocol with user-defined step duration and power increments. Users can adjust the step size in watts, the duration of each step in seconds, and the maximum power to reach.\nInterval example: Pre-defined interval workout with alternating moderate and high-intensity periods, loaded by clicking the “Beispiel Intervalldaten laden” button. This provides a standardized profile for exploring interval training responses.\nCustom data upload: Allows users to import their own power-time data from CSV files through the file upload control. The application supports different CSV formats with options for headers and separators.\n\nFor each approach, the application interpolates between data points to ensure a continuous power profile at 1-second resolution. When the “smooth power” option is enabled, a 10-second moving average filter is applied to reduce noise:\n\\[\nP_{smooth}(t) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{i=t-4}^{t+5} P(i)\n\\tag{33}\\]\nThis smoothing can help reduce the impact of measurement noise in uploaded power data, providing more stable metabolic predictions.\n\n\nPractical Implementation and Visualization\nThe exercise simulation visualizes the dynamic interplay between power output, oxygen uptake, lactate production/elimination rates, and blood lactate concentration throughout the exercise bout. This provides valuable insights into how metabolic stress evolves over time and how the timing of intensity changes affects physiological responses.\nThe visualization includes: - Power output on the primary Y-axis (left side) - Blood lactate concentration on a secondary Y-axis (right side) - Lactate production and elimination rates on the same axis as lactate - VO2 on a third Y-axis (far right) - Time on the X-axis - Markers for the lactate threshold and termination point\nThe application uses a multi-axis plotting system to display all these variables simultaneously, allowing users to observe the relationships between mechanical work, metabolic demand, and physiological responses in real time.\nThe simulation is particularly useful for:\n\nPredicting time-to-exhaustion at different constant power outputs\nOptimizing interval training protocols by visualizing the metabolic consequences of work-recovery ratios\nUnderstanding the impact of VO₂ kinetics on metabolic responses during variable-intensity exercise\nExploring how different physiological profiles (varying VO₂max, vLamax, etc.) respond to the same exercise protocol\n\nBy integrating both steady-state metabolic relationships and time-dependent kinetics, the application provides a comprehensive tool for understanding and predicting metabolic responses to exercise across a wide range of scenarios relevant to both research and applied sport science contexts."

    "text": "The Sprint Metabolism Model application implements a sophisticated simulation of the biochemical processes that occur during high-intensity exercise. Based on the foundational work of Alois Mader and Hans-Hermann Heck, this model focuses specifically on the rapid changes in metabolite concentrations that characterize sprint activities. Unlike endurance models that emphasize steady-state conditions, this sprint model captures the dynamic, non-steady-state nature of short-duration, high-intensity exercise where ATP-PCr dynamics and anaerobic glycolysis predominate.\nThe model provides a mechanistic framework for understanding muscle fatigue during sprint activities by simulating how high-energy phosphate compounds (ATP, PCr) are depleted and how metabolic by-products (lactate) accumulate over time. These simulations offer insights into the metabolic factors that limit sprint performance and the physiological determinants of sprint capacity.\n\n\n\nThe foundation of the Sprint Metabolism Model lies in understanding the equilibrium reactions that govern energy transfer in muscle cells during high-intensity exercise. Two key reactions are central to this model:\n\n\nThe Creatine Kinase (CK) reaction plays a crucial role in ATP resynthesis during the initial seconds of sprint activity:\n\\[\\text{PCr} + \\text{ADP} + \\text{H}^+ \\rightleftharpoons \\text{ATP} + \\text{Cr}\\]\nThis reaction is characterized by an equilibrium constant (\\(M_1\\)) that determines the relationship between ATP, ADP, PCr, and inorganic phosphate (Pi):\n\\[\\frac{[\\text{ATP}]}{[\\text{ADP}]} = M_1 \\cdot \\frac{[\\text{PCr}]}{[\\text{Pi}]} \\tag{1}\\]\nThe equilibrium constant \\(M_1\\) is pH-dependent and is related to the hydrogen ion concentration by:\n\\[M_1 = [H^+] \\cdot 1.66 \\times 10^9 \\text{ mol}^{-1} \\tag{2}\\]\nAt a pH of 7.0, \\(M_1\\) is approximately 166. This pH-dependency of \\(M_1\\) is physiologically significant as it shows how acidosis (decreased pH) can influence the balance between ATP and ADP.\n\n\n\nThe Adenylate Kinase (AK) reaction acts as a secondary buffer system for ATP levels:\n\\[2\\text{ADP} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{ATP} + \\text{AMP}\\]\nThis reaction is quantified by the equilibrium constant \\(M_3\\):\n\\[[\\text{ATP}] \\cdot [\\text{AMP}] = M_3 \\cdot [\\text{ADP}]^2 \\tag{3}\\]\nThe value of \\(M_3\\) typically ranges from 0.85 to 1.05, with 1.05 used as the default in the model.\n\n\n\n\nTwo critical conservation laws govern the total pool sizes of key metabolites:\n\n\nThe sum of adenine nucleotides remains constant throughout exercise:\n\\[S[A] = [\\text{ATP}] + [\\text{ADP}] + [\\text{AMP}] \\tag{4}\\]\nWhere \\(S[A]\\) is typically around 7 mmol·kg\\(^{-1}\\) muscle wet weight.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the total phosphate pool remains constant:\n\\[S[C] = [\\text{PCr}] + [\\text{Pi}] \\tag{5}\\]\nWhere \\(S[C]\\) is typically around 26-28 mmol·kg\\(^{-1}\\) muscle wet weight.\n\n\n\n\nBy combining the equilibrium and conservation equations, we can derive expressions for calculating the concentrations of all metabolites based on the current PCr and Pi levels.\nFirst, we define a variable \\(Q\\) based on the Creatine Kinase equilibrium:\n\\[Q = M_1 \\cdot \\frac{[\\text{PCr}]}{[\\text{Pi}]} \\tag{6}\\]\nUsing this variable, we can express ADP concentration as:\n\\[[\\text{ADP}] = \\frac{S[A] \\cdot Q}{M_3 + Q + Q^2} \\tag{7}\\]\nOnce ADP is calculated, ATP and AMP can be determined:\n\\[[\\text{ATP}] = [\\text{ADP}] \\cdot Q \\tag{8}\\]\n\\[[\\text{AMP}] = S[A] - [\\text{ATP}] - [\\text{ADP}] \\tag{9}\\]\nThese equations allow us to calculate the complete metabolite profile at any point during exercise, based on the changing PCr concentration.\n\n\n\nIn the Sprint Metabolism Model, ATP consumption can be specified in two ways:\n\n\nThis approach directly specifies the rate of ATP utilization during exercise:\n\\[\\text{ATP consumption rate} = \\text{mmol} \\cdot \\text{kg}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} \\tag{10}\\]\nTypical values range from 0.5 to 5 mmol·kg\\(^{-1}\\)·s\\(^{-1}\\), with higher values representing more intense sprint efforts.\n\n\n\nThis alternative approach calculates ATP consumption based on mechanical power output:\n\\[\\text{ATP consumption rate} = \\frac{\\text{Power (W)}}{\\text{Active Muscle Mass (kg)}} \\cdot \\text{WATT\\_TO\\_ATP\\_FACTOR} \\tag{11}\\]\nWhere WATT_TO_ATP_FACTOR is approximately 0.05 mmol·kg\\(^{-1}\\)·s\\(^{-1}\\) per W·kg\\(^{-1}\\).\nThis conversion factor represents the biochemical efficiency of converting ATP energy to mechanical work, accounting for the efficiency losses in the contraction process.\n\n\n\n\nAs PCr becomes depleted and ADP accumulates, glycolysis is activated to provide additional ATP. The activation of glycolysis follows a sigmoid relationship with ADP concentration:\n\\[v_{\\text{La\\_rate}} = \\frac{v_{\\text{La\\_max}} \\cdot [\\text{ADP}]^3}{KS2 + [\\text{ADP}]^3} \\tag{12}\\]\nWhere: - \\(v_{\\text{La\\_max}}\\) is the maximum lactate formation rate (a key parameter representing glycolytic capacity) - \\(KS2\\) is approximately \\((0.15)^3 = 0.003375\\) mmol·kg\\(^{-1}\\) - \\([\\text{ADP}]\\) is the ADP concentration in mmol·kg\\(^{-1}\\)\nThis equation represents a Hill equation with a coefficient of 3, reflecting the steep activation of glycolysis as ADP increases. The cubic relationship with ADP is particularly important for capturing the rapid acceleration of glycolysis during sprint exercise.\n\n\n\nThe free energy available from ATP hydrolysis (\\(\\Delta G_{\\text{ATP}}\\)) is a critical factor in determining when muscular fatigue occurs:\n\\[\\Delta G_{\\text{ATP}} = \\Delta G^0 + RT \\ln\\frac{[\\text{ADP}][\\text{Pi}]}{[\\text{ATP}]} \\tag{13}\\]\nWhere: - \\(\\Delta G^0\\) is approximately -30.5 kJ·mol\\(^{-1}\\) - \\(R\\) is the gas constant (8.314 J·mol\\(^{-1}\\)·K\\(^{-1}\\)) - \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature (310 K or 37°C)\nAs exercise progresses and ATP decreases while ADP and Pi increase, the absolute value of \\(\\Delta G_{\\text{ATP}}\\) decreases, providing less energy for muscle contraction. When ATP falls below approximately 65% of its initial concentration, the free energy becomes insufficient for maintaining muscle force, leading to fatigue.\nThis concept forms the basis for the termination threshold in the simulation, where exercise is considered to end when ATP drops below a user-specified percentage of the initial value (typically 65%).\n\n\n\nThe model implements a time-step approach to simulate the dynamic changes in metabolite concentrations during sprint exercise:\n\nInitialize PCr, Pi, and calculate initial ATP, ADP, and AMP concentrations\nFor each time step (\\(\\Delta t\\), typically 0.05 seconds):\n\nCalculate ATP consumption for the current time step\nReduce PCr by the corresponding amount to resynthesize ATP\nUpdate Pi based on PCr consumption (conservation of total phosphate)\nRecalculate ATP, ADP, and AMP concentrations using equilibrium equations\nCalculate lactate formation rate and accumulate lactate\nCheck if termination criteria are met (ATP below threshold)\n\n\nThis approach allows the model to capture the rapidly changing metabolite concentrations during sprint exercise with high temporal resolution.\n\n\n\nThe application implements the simulation through a series of equations applied at each time step:\n\n\nFor the starting condition, the model calculates the initial equilibrium state:\n\\[Q_{t0} = M_1 \\cdot \\frac{[\\text{PCr}_0]}{[\\text{Pi}_0]} \\tag{14}\\]\n\\[[\\text{ADP}_0] = \\frac{S[A] \\cdot Q_{t0}}{M_3 + Q_{t0} + Q_{t0}^2} \\tag{15}\\]\n\\[[\\text{ATP}_0] = [\\text{ADP}_0] \\cdot Q_{t0} \\tag{16}\\]\n\\[[\\text{AMP}_0] = S[A] - [\\text{ATP}_0] - [\\text{ADP}_0] \\tag{17}\\]\n\n\n\nFor each time step, the model calculates:\n\nATP consumption based on the selected mode: \\[\\text{ATP needed} = \\text{ATP consumption rate} \\cdot \\Delta t \\tag{18}\\]\nPCr utilization to resynthesize ATP: \\[\\text{PCr used} = \\min([\\text{PCr}], \\text{ATP needed}) \\tag{19}\\] \\[[\\text{PCr}]_{t+\\Delta t} = [\\text{PCr}]_t - \\text{PCr used} \\tag{20}\\]\nUpdate Pi based on PCr consumption: \\[[\\text{Pi}]_{t+\\Delta t} = S[C] - [\\text{PCr}]_{t+\\Delta t} \\tag{21}\\]\nRecalculate Q, ADP, ATP, and AMP: \\[Q_{t+\\Delta t} = M_1 \\cdot \\frac{[\\text{PCr}]_{t+\\Delta t}}{[\\text{Pi}]_{t+\\Delta t}} \\tag{22}\\]\n\\[[\\text{ADP}]_{t+\\Delta t} = \\frac{S[A] \\cdot Q_{t+\\Delta t}}{M_3 + Q_{t+\\Delta t} + Q_{t+\\Delta t}^2} \\tag{23}\\]\n\\[[\\text{ATP}]_{t+\\Delta t} = [\\text{ADP}]_{t+\\Delta t} \\cdot Q_{t+\\Delta t} \\tag{24}\\]\n\\[[\\text{AMP}]_{t+\\Delta t} = S[A] - [\\text{ATP}]_{t+\\Delta t} - [\\text{ADP}]_{t+\\Delta t} \\tag{25}\\]\nCalculate lactate formation rate: \\[v_{\\text{La\\_rate}} = \\frac{v_{\\text{La\\_max}} \\cdot [\\text{ADP}]_{t+\\Delta t}^3}{KS2 + [\\text{ADP}]_{t+\\Delta t}^3} \\tag{26}\\]\n\\[[\\text{La}]_{t+\\Delta t} = [\\text{La}]_t + v_{\\text{La\\_rate}} \\cdot \\Delta t \\tag{27}\\]\nCheck termination criteria: \\[\\text{If } [\\text{ATP}]_{t+\\Delta t} &lt; \\frac{\\text{threshold}}{100} \\cdot [\\text{ATP}_0] \\text{ then terminate} \\tag{28}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe application includes a feature to estimate the initial PCr concentration based on body mass and active muscle percentage:\n\\[[\\text{PCr}_0] = \\text{basePCr} + \\text{massAdjustment} + \\text{muscleAdjustment} \\tag{29}\\]\nWhere: - basePCr is the typical value for a healthy adult (≈ 23 mmol·kg\\(^{-1}\\)) - massAdjustment = (bodyMass - 70) × 0.02 - muscleAdjustment = (activeMassPerc - 30) × 0.1\nThis estimation reflects the observation that PCr concentration tends to be higher in more muscular individuals and lower in less active individuals. The function constrains the estimated value to a physiologically plausible range of 15-30 mmol·kg\\(^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\nThe simulation results can be interpreted in terms of the different energy systems that contribute to sprint performance:\n\nATP-PCr System (0-10 seconds): The initial phase shows rapid PCr depletion with relatively stable ATP concentrations, demonstrating the critical buffer role of PCr.\nGlycolytic Contribution (5-20+ seconds): As PCr depletes, ADP increases, activating glycolysis as indicated by the rising lactate formation rate. This represents the transition from PCr to glycolytic dominance.\nFatigue Onset (Termination Point): The point where ATP falls below the critical threshold (typically 65% of initial value) represents the theoretical time at which muscle contraction would become impaired in an actual sprint.\n\nThe model also illustrates key physiological principles:\n\nBuffer Effect of PCr: The initial stability of ATP despite high energy demands demonstrates PCr’s crucial role in buffering ATP levels.\nDelayed Glycolytic Activation: The lag in lactate formation illustrates the delayed activation of glycolysis, which requires ADP accumulation.\nEnergy System Transition: The crossover between PCr depletion and glycolytic activation represents the transition between immediate (ATP-PCr) and short-term (glycolytic) energy systems.\nMetabolic Limitation to Sprint Performance: The termination time provides insight into the metabolic factors that limit sprint duration and intensity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining Prescription: The model can help determine the appropriate work-to-rest ratios for sprint interval training by showing how long it takes to substantially deplete PCr and how long recovery periods should be to allow adequate PCr resynthesis.\nIndividual Differences: By adjusting model parameters (PCr0, vLa_max, active muscle mass), coaches and researchers can explore how individual physiological differences affect sprint performance and fatigue resistance.\nEquipment Selection: Power-based analysis can inform equipment choices (e.g., gear ratios) by showing how different power demands affect metabolic responses and fatigue onset.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimplification of Complex Systems: The model simplifies many aspects of muscle metabolism, including the spatial distribution of metabolites, fiber type heterogeneity, and complex enzyme kinetics.\nFixed Parameter Assumptions: Some parameters (e.g., pH) are assumed constant although they change during intense exercise.\nMechanical Factors Not Included: The model focuses on metabolic factors but does not account for mechanical factors like muscle elasticity, neuromuscular fatigue, or coordination.\nValidation Challenges: Direct validation of the model is challenging because invasive techniques are required to measure intramuscular metabolite concentrations during sprint exercise.\n\nDespite these limitations, the Sprint Metabolism Model provides valuable insights into the dynamic metabolic processes that underlie sprint performance and fatigue, serving as a powerful tool for research, education, and applied sport science."

The application’s core framework is deeply rooted in the established metabolic principles and sophisticated mathematical models developed over decades by Prof. Dr. Alois Mader and his collaborators (e.g., Mader (1984); Mader & Heck (1986); Mader & Allmer (1996); Mader (2003)). This tool empowers users—ranging from students and coaches to researchers and athletes—to explore complex physiological interactions in two primary modes:\n\nSteady-state metabolic responses to a spectrum of power outputs. This mode allows for detailed examination of the intricate relationships between mechanical power, oxygen uptake (\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\)), the kinetics of lactate production (\\(vLa_{SS}\\)) and lactate oxidation (\\(vLa_{ox}\\)), the resulting pyruvate deficit (PD), and the theoretical lactate accumulation. This is accessible via the “P-V̇O₂-La Dynamics” tab.\nDynamic metabolic changes as they unfold during exercise. This mode facilitates the simulation of physiological responses to predefined exercise protocols, such as incremental step tests, or to custom-loaded power data from actual training sessions or laboratory tests.

    "section": "Tab 1: P-V̇O₂-La Dynamics (Steady-State Model)",
    "text": "Tab 1: P-V̇O₂-La Dynamics (Steady-State Model)\nThis section of the application is dedicated to exploring the metabolic responses of the human body under the assumption that a physiological steady state has been reached for each given power output. The calculations are primarily based on Prof. Mader’s comprehensive metabolic model, which intricately links aerobic energy production with anaerobic glycolysis and lactate metabolism.\n\nControl Panel: P-V̇O₂-La Dynamics\nLocated in the sidebar, this panel contains several control groups that allow the user to precisely adjust the model parameters for the steady-state analysis. Each parameter influences the shape and characteristics of the P-\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\)-La curves.\n\nOxygen Demand Settings\nThis section defines the fundamental relationship between mechanical power output (P, typically in Watts) and the corresponding steady-state oxygen uptake (\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,SS}\\), typically in ml·min⁻¹). This P-\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) relationship is a cornerstone of exercise physiology, as its slope and intercept reflect the overall efficiency of converting metabolic energy into external mechanical work.\n\nCurvilinear CE relationship (Checkbox): This toggle allows the user to select between two distinct mathematical models for describing the P-\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) relationship:\n\nLinear Model (Unchecked - Default): This model assumes a constant oxygen cost per unit of work performed above the baseline oxygen uptake (\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\)). The relationship is mathematically defined as: \\[ \\dot{V}O_{2,SS} = CE \\cdot P + \\dot{V}O_{2,Base} \\] In this equation, \\(CE\\) (Cost of Exercise) represents the slope of the line (\\(\\Delta\\dot{V}O_2 / \\Delta P\\)), indicating the volume of oxygen (in ml/min) required for each additional Watt of power output. \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) is the y-intercept, representing the oxygen uptake during rest + oxygen uptake of unloaded cycling (i.e., the metabolic cost associated with moving the limbs against minimal internal resistance without performing significant external work on the ergometer).\nCurvilinear Model (Checked): This model implements a quadratic (second-order polynomial) relationship. It acknowledges the widely observed physiological phenomenon that mechanical efficiency often decreases at higher exercise intensities, particularly above the lactate threshold or critical power. This leads to a disproportionally greater increase in \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) for a given increment in power output. This upward deviation from linearity is related to the “\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) slow component” observed during prolonged constant-load exercise (Barstow, 1994; Hintzy-Cloutier et al., 2003; Zoladz et al., 1995), but here it’s applied to describe the steady-state \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) across different intensities. The formula used is: \\[ \\dot{V}O_{2,SS} = a \\cdot P^2 + CE_{Start} \\cdot P + \\dot{V}O_{2,Base} \\] \\(CE_{Start}\\) represents the initial slope (and thus initial efficiency) at very low power outputs. The coefficient \\(a\\) determines the degree of curvature of the P-\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) relationship. Within the app, this coefficient \\(a\\) is automatically calculated. This calculation is designed such that the slope of this curvilinear P-\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) relationship, specifically at the power output where \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,SS}\\) would theoretically intersect \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\), matches the user-defined \\(CE_{Target}\\) value. This sophisticated approach allows for a more nuanced representation of how efficiency changes across the intensity spectrum.\n\nCE (ml·min⁻¹·W⁻¹):\n\nThis slider sets the constant Cost of Exercise (\\(CE\\)). While the app’s slider offers a broad range (8 to 15 ml·min⁻¹·W⁻¹), typical physiological values for well-trained cyclists often fall within a narrower band, generally between 10.0 and 12.0 ml·min⁻¹·W⁻¹ (Åstrand et al., 2003; Rassouli & Thurnheer, 2015). Values outside this range can certainly occur, depending on factors like training status (untrained individuals may have higher CEs), muscle fiber type composition, pedaling technique, and even equipment (e.g., aerodynamic drag at higher speeds, though this model primarily focuses on ergometer cycling). Lower CE values inherently indicate higher gross mechanical efficiency for the external work performed.\nDelta Efficiency (Δη): This derived metric quantifies the efficiency of converting metabolic energy into additional mechanical work, specifically the efficiency of the work performed above the \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) level. It is calculated from the \\(CE\\) value and the caloric equivalent of oxygen (energy yield per liter of O₂ consumed). A critical point is that the caloric equivalent of oxygen is not constant; it varies depending on the substrate mixture being oxidized, which is reflected by the Respiratory Quotient (RQ). RQ values typically range from approximately 0.70 (pure fat oxidation) to 1.00 (pure carbohydrate oxidation), corresponding to caloric equivalents from approximately 19.6 kJ·L O₂⁻¹ to 21.1 kJ·L O₂⁻¹ (Stegemann, 1991). Because the app dynamically calculates a predicted RQ based on the modeled substrate utilization, Δη is presented as a range (e.g., 24.7-26.5%) to account for this RQ variability across intensities. Conceptually, Δη can be thought of as: \\[ \\Delta\\eta = \\frac{\\text{Change in Work Rate}}{\\text{Change in Energy Expenditure Rate above } \\dot{V}O_{2,Base}} \\] A more direct calculation based on CE is: \\[ \\Delta\\eta = \\frac{1}{\\left( \\frac{CE \\cdot \\text{Caloric Equivalent per L O}_2}{60} \\right)} \\] where CE is in ml O₂·min⁻¹·W⁻¹, Caloric Equivalent per L O₂ is in kJ·L O₂⁻¹, and the division by 60 converts the denominator (which represents oxygen cost in kJ per kJ of work) from a per Watt basis to a per kJ/min basis to match the numerator (implicitly 1 kJ/min of work for 1 kJ/min of energy expenditure if efficiency were 100%). Note: 1 W = 1 J·s⁻¹ = 0.06 kJ·min⁻¹.\nηgross (Fatmax | MLSS): Gross efficiency (ηgross) is a fundamental measure of whole-body mechanical efficiency. It is calculated as the ratio of the mechanical work performed (Power output, converted from Watts to kJ/min) to the total aerobic energy expenditure (also in kJ/min, derived from \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,SS}\\) and its caloric equivalent): \\[ \\eta_{\\text{gross}} = \\frac{\\text{Power output [kJ/min]}}{\\text{Total Aerobic Energy Expenditure [kJ/min]}} \\times 100\\% \\] The Mader App calculates and displays ηgross at two physiologically significant power outputs:\n\nFatmax: The power output at which the rate of fat oxidation is maximal. This intensity is often targeted in training for enhancing fat metabolism.\nMLSS (Maximal Lactate Steady State): The highest power output that can theoretically be sustained for a prolonged period (e.g., 30-60 minutes) without a continual rise in blood lactate concentration. This is a critical marker of endurance performance. The app uses its internal model to predict the RQ at these specific intensities (Fatmax and MLSS) to determine the most accurate caloric equivalent for oxygen for these ηgross calculations. Typical gross efficiencies observed in cycling are in the range of 19-22% (Coyle et al., 1991; Faria et al., 2005).\n\nηnet (Fatmax | MLSS): Net efficiency (ηnet) is conceptually similar to gross efficiency but aims to isolate the efficiency of the muscular work itself by subtracting the energy expenditure at rest (\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\)). The formula is: \\[ \\eta_{\\text{net}} = \\frac{\\text{Power output [kJ/min]}}{(\\text{Total Aerobic Energy Expenditure [kJ/min]}) - (\\text{Energy Expenditure at } \\dot{V}O_{2,Base} \\text{ [kJ/min]})} \\times 100\\% \\] Net efficiency values are typically higher than gross efficiency values because the “baseline” metabolic cost is excluded from the denominator. In cycling, ηnet values often range from 19-24%, although precise values depend heavily on how the baseline energy expenditure is defined and measured (Di Prampero et al., 1979; Stainbsy et al., 1980). The app calculates ηnet at both Fatmax and MLSS, again using predicted RQs for caloric equivalents.\n\nCEStart (ml·min⁻¹·W⁻¹): (Visible and active only when the Curvilinear model is selected)\n\nThis slider sets the initial slope of the \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\)-P curve, representing the oxygen cost (and thus efficiency) at very low power outputs, near the \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\).\n\nCETarget (ml·min⁻¹·W⁻¹): (Visible and active only when the Curvilinear model is selected)\n\nThis slider sets the target slope of the \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\)-P curve specifically at the power output corresponding to \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\). This parameter is crucial for defining the extent of the “tail-up” or steepening of the curvilinear P-\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) relationship at high exercise intensities.\n\n\n\n\nCadence Dependency\nThis section introduces an feature allowing users to incorporate the effects of pedaling rate on metabolic parameters. The underlying model for these adjustments is primarily based on the research and formulas published by Dunst et al. (2025). The general physiological principle is that there’s an optimal cadence range where mechanical and metabolic efficiency are maximized. Deviating from this optimal range, either by pedaling too slowly or too quickly, typically increases the oxygen cost for a given power output due to factors such as increased internal work (cost of limb movement), less favorable muscle force-velocity characteristics, or altered muscle recruitment patterns (Chavarren & Calbet, 1999; Foss & Hallén, 2005).\n\nEnable U-Shaped Cadence Dependency (Checkbox):\n\nWhen this box is checked, the app dynamically adjusts key metabolic parameters (\\(CE\\), \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\), and optionally \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) and \\(vLa_{max}\\)) based on the cadence value selected by the user.\n\nCadence (rpm) (Slider):\n\nAllows the user to set the cycling cadence in revolutions per minute (rpm). The default value is 80 rpm, but the slider typically covers a wide physiological range (e.g., 20-200 rpm). While preferred cadences in trained cyclists often hover around 80-100 rpm during submaximal, steady-state cycling (Lucía et al., 2001), optimal cadences can vary with intensity and individual characteristics.\n\nCE-Dependency (Informational - automatically applied if cadence dependency is enabled):\n\nIndicates that the Cost of Exercise (\\(CE\\)) is no longer a fixed input (if the linear model was active) but becomes a dynamic function of the selected cadence. The app uses the quadratic formula derived by Dunst et al. (2025): \\(CE(rpm) = 0.0004 \\cdot rpm^2 - 0.094 \\cdot rpm + 16.857\\). This U-shaped function implies a minimum CE (highest efficiency) at a certain cadence, with CE increasing at lower and higher cadences.\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) Dependency (Informational - automatically applied if cadence dependency is enabled):\n\nSimilarly, the baseline oxygen uptake (\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\)) also becomes cadence-dependent, reflecting the metabolic cost of \\(\\dot{V}O_{2}\\) at Rest + additional \\(\\dot{V}O_{2}\\) for unloaded pedaling at different speeds. The formula from Dunst et al. (2025) is: \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}(rpm) = 0.172 \\cdot rpm^2 - 14.460 \\cdot rpm + 548.039\\). This also typically describes a U-shaped relationship.\n\nInclude \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) Dependency (Checkbox):\n\nIf this option is checked, the individual’s \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) is also modeled as being influenced by cadence. This is presented as an experimental feature, qualitatively based on figures in Dunst et al. (2025) which suggest that \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) might be slightly lower at very low or very high cadences, with an optimal range typically around 80-90 rpm. The physiological basis could relate to optimal muscle recruitment and force-velocity characteristics for achieving maximal aerobic power.\n\nInclude vLamax Dependency (Checkbox):\n\nIf this option is checked, the maximal rate of lactate production (vLamax) is adjusted based on the selected cadence, using the formula proposed by Dunst et al. (2025): \\(vLa_{max}(rpm) = -0.0002 \\cdot rpm^2 + 0.00931 \\cdot rpm\\). It is important to note, as highlighted in the app’s tooltip and by Dunst et al. (2025), that this observed cadence-dependency of vLamax (often showing higher vLamax at higher cadences) might be partly or wholly an artifact of common sprint testing methodologies (e.g., isokinetic sprints where higher cadences might facilitate greater recruitment of fast-twitch fibers or alter torque production) rather than a true change in the intrinsic maximal glycolytic capacity of the muscle.\n\n\n\n\nPhysiological Input-Parameters\nThese sliders allow the user to define the core physiological characteristics of the simulated individual. These parameters are fundamental to Mader’s metabolic model and significantly influence all calculated outputs.\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) (ml·min⁻¹):\n\nMaximal oxygen uptake. This is a cornerstone of aerobic fitness assessment, representing the highest rate at which an individual can take up, transport, and utilize oxygen during maximal, dynamic exercise (Åstrand et al., 2003; Levine, 2008). It sets the upper limit for aerobic ATP resynthesis.\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) (ml·min⁻¹·kg⁻¹):\n\nMaximal oxygen uptake expressed relative to body mass (in kilograms). This normalized value allows for comparisons of aerobic fitness between individuals of different body sizes. This slider is dynamically linked to the absolute \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) slider and the Body Mass slider; changing any one of these three will automatically update the others to maintain consistency.\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) (ml·min⁻¹):\n\nOxygen uptake at Rest as well as oxygen uptake for unloaded cycling (i.e., cycling at zero external power output on the ergometer, but still involving the metabolic cost of limb movement, postural support, and elevated cardiorespiratory activity compared to true rest). This value is critical as it forms the y-intercept of the P-\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) relationship. It can be estimated using the “\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) Calculation” utility (see below) which estimates true resting \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\), or it can be set manually based on typical values or direct measurements from unloaded cycling.\n\nvLamax (mmol·l⁻¹·s⁻¹):\n\nMaximal rate of lactate production. This parameter reflects the peak enzymatic capacity of the anaerobic glycolytic pathway to produce lactate (and ATP) per unit of time and per liter of blood/distribution volume (Mader, 1984; Mader & Allmer, 1996). It is a crucial determinant of an individual’s anaerobic capacity and significantly influences lactate accumulation kinetics and substrate utilization patterns. Typical values can range widely, from approximately 0.3 mmol·l⁻¹·s⁻¹ in highly trained endurance athletes to over 1.0 mmol·l⁻¹·s⁻¹ in elite sprint athletes.\n\nHRmax (bpm):\n\nMaximal heart rate achievable by the individual during exhaustive exercise. Commonly estimated by formulas like “220 - age”, but this has large individual variability. Direct measurement is preferred for accuracy.\n\nHRBase (bpm):\n\nBaseline heart rate at rest.\n\nCEHR (bpm·W⁻¹):\n\nHeart Rate Efficiency, also commonly referred to as the HR-Power slope. It describes the increment in heart rate (in beats per minute) for each Watt increase in external power output during steady-state incremental exercise. Typical values in cyclists range from 0.25 to 0.45 bpm·W⁻¹. Lower values are generally indicative of better cardiovascular efficiency, often reflecting a larger stroke volume response to increasing exercise intensity.\n\nWeight-based values (Checkbox):\n\nIf checked, the x-axis of the main P-\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\)-La plot and several displayed output values (e.g., power, \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\)) will be normalized to the individual’s body mass. This is useful for comparing individuals of different sizes, as many physiological parameters scale with body mass. Power would be displayed in W·kg⁻¹ and \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) in ml·min⁻¹·kg⁻¹.\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) Calculation\nThis utility provides a method to estimate an individual’s true basal metabolic rate (BMR) using the widely recognized Harris-Benedict equation (J. A. Harris & Benedict, 1918). This BMR is then converted into an equivalent resting oxygen uptake. While this calculated resting \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) is not always directly the \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) used in this model, it can serve as a physiologically grounded reference point for setting or evaluating the \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) parameter without the additional oxygen cost of unloaded cycling.\n\nGender (Radio buttons: Male/Female): Selects the appropriate gender-specific version of the Harris-Benedict formula, as metabolic rates differ between sexes.\nBody Mass (kg) (Slider): Input for the Harris-Benedict formula. Also used for weight-based normalizations throughout the app if the “Weight-based values” checkbox is active.\nAge (years) (Slider): Input for the Harris-Benedict formula, as BMR typically declines with age.\nHeight (cm) (Slider): Input for the Harris-Benedict formula.\nCalculate \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) Button:\n\nWhen clicked, the app calculates BMR in kilocalories per day (kcal/day) using the selected inputs and the Harris-Benedict equations:\n\nMen: BMR = 66.5 + (13.75 × weight in kg) + (5.003 × height in cm) – (6.775 × age in years)\nWomen: BMR = 655.1 + (9.563 × weight in kg) + (1.850 × height in cm) – (4.676 × age in years)\n\nThis BMR (kcal/day) is then converted to a resting \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) value (in ml/min) using standard caloric equivalents for oxygen (approximately 4.825 kcal per liter of O₂ consumed at a typical resting RQ of 0.82-0.85, or a more generic ~5 kcal/L O₂).\nThe \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) slider in the “Physiological Input-Parameters” section is automatically updated with this calculated resting \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) value.\nImportant Distinction: It’s crucial to remember that the \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) parameter in Mader’s model represents oxygen uptake during unloaded cycling. This value is inherently higher than the true basal resting \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) (as estimated by Harris-Benedict) because it includes the metabolic cost of limb movement, maintaining posture on the bike, and slightly elevated cardiorespiratory activity. The Harris-Benedict calculation here provides a physiological baseline for resting energy expenditure.\n\n\n\n\nSubstrate Utilization\nThis section enables the modeling and visualization of how the body utilizes carbohydrates (CHO) and fats for aerobic energy production across different exercise intensities. The model’s approach is rooted in the lactate balance concept from Mader’s framework (Mader, 2003), where the interplay between lactate production and oxidation serves as an indicator of the relative reliance on CHO versus fat metabolism.\n\nShow Substrate Utilization (Checkbox):\n\nIf this box is checked:\n\nA dedicated Substrate Utilization Plot appears below the main P-V̇O₂-La plot. This plot displays the percentage contribution of CHO and Fat to total aerobic energy expenditure across the range of power outputs.\nTraces representing the absolute rates of CHO and Fat oxidation (in the units selected via the “Energy Unit” dropdown) are added to the main P-V̇O₂-La plot. These are typically plotted on a third y-axis (yaxis3) to accommodate their different scale compared to \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) or lactate rates.\n\n\nEnergy Unit (Dropdown menu): (Visible only if “Show Substrate Utilization” is checked)\n\nAllows the user to select the preferred units for displaying the absolute substrate oxidation rates. Options are:\n\ng/h (grams per hour): Useful for nutritional planning and understanding fuel mass turnover.\nkcal/h (kilocalories per hour): A common unit for energy expenditure.\nkJ/h (kilojoules per hour): The SI unit for energy expenditure.\n\n\nAdjust CHO utilization at rest (Checkbox): (Visible only if “Show Substrate Utilization” is checked)\n\nIf checked, this feature allows the user to manually influence the modeled CHO utilization percentage specifically at rest (0 Watts power output). The Mader model, by default, calculates CHO utilization based purely on its internal lactate kinetics (\\(vLa_{SS}/vLa_{ox}\\) ratio). However, empirical studies often show that at true rest, particularly in a post-absorptive state, fat oxidation predominates, and CHO contribution might be around 35-40% (Brooks, 2012; Friedlander et al., 1998, 1999). This option allows users to align the model’s resting substrate use more closely with such empirical observations or specific dietary conditions if desired.\n\nResting CHO percentage (%) (Slider): (Visible only if “Adjust CHO utilization at rest” is checked)\n\nA slider (0-100%) to set the target CHO utilization percentage at rest (0 Watts). The application will then adjust the entire CHO utilization curve proportionally to pass through (or near) this user-defined resting value, while still adhering to the model’s logic at higher intensities (e.g., approaching 100% CHO at MLSS).\n\n\nModel Basis for Substrate Utilization: The Mader model posits a strong link between lactate metabolism and substrate choice. The fundamental idea is that increased glycolytic flux (leading to lactate production, \\(vLa_{SS}\\)) signifies a shift towards carbohydrate utilization. Conversely, conditions favoring lactate clearance and oxidation (\\(vLa_{ox}\\)) are associated with a greater capacity for, and reliance on, fat oxidation. The model calculates the percentage CHO contribution based on the ratio of \\(vLa_{SS}\\) to \\(vLa_{ox}\\). As exercise intensity increases and \\(vLa_{SS}\\) rises (potentially exceeding \\(vLa_{ox}\\)), CHO% increases, approaching 100% at or above MLSS (where PD ≤ 0). Fat oxidation percentage is calculated as (100 - CHO%). The absolute rates of CHO and fat oxidation (in g/h, kcal/h, or kJ/h) are then derived from the total aerobic energy expenditure (calculated from \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,SS}\\) and its caloric equivalent) and these percentages. Standard energy yields (e.g., ~4.1 kcal/g for CHO, ~9.45 kcal/g for fat) are used for these conversions. Crucially, the predicted Respiratory Quotient (RQ = \\(\\dot{V}CO_2 / \\dot{V}O_2\\)) is calculated from this modeled substrate mix (RQ ≈ 0.70 for 100% fat, RQ ≈ 1.00 for 100% CHO). This dynamically predicted RQ is then used in conjunction with established tables (similar to those by Stegemann (1991)) to determine the precise caloric equivalent of oxygen (e.g., kJ·l O₂⁻¹ or kcal·l O₂⁻¹) at each power output. This RQ-dependent caloric equivalent is then used for the accurate calculation of all efficiency metrics (Δη, ηgross, ηnet). This creates a physiologically consistent loop where substrate use influences RQ, which influences caloric equivalent, which influences efficiency calculations. The intensity at which fat oxidation is maximal (Fatmax) typically occurs where the Pyruvate Deficit is highest. For a detailed understanding of factors influencing fat oxidation, refer to reviews like Achten & Jeukendrup (2004).\n\n\nPlot Settings\n\nLock Y-Axis / Lock X-Axis (Checkboxes):\n\nWhen checked (default state), the respective axis range on the main P-V̇O₂-La plot remains fixed, regardless of changes to input parameters. This is highly beneficial for visual comparison, as it allows the user to clearly see how alterations in (for example) \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) or \\(CE\\) shift the curves relative to a constant scale.\nIf unchecked, the axis will auto-scale to optimally fit the currently plotted data. This can be useful for initial exploration if the parameter changes result in data that goes off the fixed scale, but makes direct comparison of curve shifts more difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Plot: P-V̇O₂-La Dynamics\nThis central graphical output is the primary visualization for the steady-state model, displaying the complex interrelationships between power output and key metabolic variables.\n\nX-Axis: Power output (P). Units are Watts (W) by default, or Watts per kilogram body mass (W·kg⁻¹) if the “Weight-based values” option is selected in the sidebar.\nPrimary Y-Axis (Left side of plot): Oxygen Uptake (\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\)). Units are milliliters per minute (ml·min⁻¹) or ml·min⁻¹·kg⁻¹ if weight-based.\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,SS}\\) (Solid Blue Line): This trace represents the calculated steady-state oxygen uptake at each power output, up to the individual’s defined \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\). The shape of this curve is determined by whether the linear or curvilinear CE model is selected, and by the specific CE parameters.\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,SS,extrapolated}\\) (Dashed Blue Line): This line shows the theoretical \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) demand if it were not physiologically constrained by the individual’s \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\). It essentially continues the P-\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) relationship defined by the CE model beyond the point where \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) is reached.\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) Line (Dotted Grey Horizontal Line): A clear visual representation of the individual’s maximal oxygen uptake, serving as the ceiling for the \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,SS}\\) curve.\n\nSecondary Y-Axis (Right side of plot - typically labeled yaxis2): This axis displays variables related to lactate kinetics. Rates are typically in mmol·l⁻¹·min⁻¹, and accumulation in mmol·l⁻¹.\n\nvLaSS (Dashed Red Line): The steady-state rate of lactate production into the blood/distribution volume. In Mader’s model, \\(vLa_{SS}\\) is a function of the relative exercise intensity (related to the difference between \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) and current \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,SS}\\)), the individual’s maximal glycolytic capacity (vLamax), and constants reflecting enzyme kinetics and substrate availability.\nvLaox (Dashed Light Blue Line): The steady-state rate of lactate oxidation or clearance from the blood/distribution volume. This is primarily dependent on the aerobic metabolic rate (\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,SS}\\)), as lactate is oxidized in various tissues (muscle, heart, liver) or converted to glucose (gluconeogenesis), both processes requiring oxygen directly or indirectly.\nPD (Pyruvate Deficit) (Solid Purple Line): Calculated as the difference: \\(vLa_{ox} - vLa_{SS}\\).\n\nA positive PD indicates that the capacity for lactate elimination (\\(vLa_{ox}\\)) exceeds the rate of lactate production (\\(vLa_{SS}\\)). This state is typically associated with lower to moderate exercise intensities and often correlates with a higher proportion of fat oxidation.\nA negative PD indicates that lactate production (\\(vLa_{SS}\\)) exceeds the elimination capacity (\\(vLa_{ox}\\)), leading to a net accumulation of lactate if the exercise were sustained.\nFATmax (Vertical Dotted Grey Line Annotation): This line is drawn at the power output where the Pyruvate Deficit (PD) reaches its maximum positive value. This intensity is often considered to approximate the point of maximal fat oxidation, as a large PD implies a metabolic environment conducive to fat metabolism (lower glycolytic flux relative to oxidative capacity).\nMLSS (Maximal Lactate Steady State) (Vertical Dotted Grey Line Annotation): This line is drawn at the power output where PD is theoretically zero (i.e., \\(vLa_{SS} = vLa_{ox}\\)). This represents the highest exercise intensity at which lactate production and elimination are balanced, allowing for a stable (though elevated) blood lactate concentration during prolonged, constant-load exercise. MLSS is a critical determinant of endurance performance (Heck et al., 2022).\n\nLaAccumulation (Solid Dark Red Line): This trace represents the theoretical steady-state blood lactate concentration that would result if exercise at that specific power output were maintained indefinitely. It is derived from the net balance of lactate production and elimination (i.e., the integral of -PD over time, assuming a starting lactate concentration). It’s important to note that this is a modeled steady-state prediction and not a dynamic simulation of blood lactate changes over a fixed exercise duration.\n\nTertiary Y-Axis (Right side, typically further out - yaxis3, visible only if “Show Substrate Utilization” is checked): This axis is dedicated to displaying the absolute rates of substrate utilization, in the units selected by the user (g/h, kcal/h, or kJ/h).\n\nCHO (Unit) (Dotted Pink Line): Shows the absolute rate of carbohydrate oxidation at each power output.\nFat (Unit) (Dotted Green Line): Shows the absolute rate of fat oxidation at each power output.\n\n\nThe plot is richly annotated, providing values for FATmax power, MLSS power, and the absolute \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) value. Additionally, the specific mathematical formula currently being used to define the \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\)-P relationship (linear or curvilinear, and reflecting any cadence-dependent adjustments to CE and \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\)) is displayed directly on the plot for clarity.\n\n\nSubstrate Utilization Plot\nThis second plot appears below the main P-V̇O₂-La plot only if the “Show Substrate Utilization” option is enabled in the control panel. It provides a percentage-based view of fuel use.\n\nX-Axis: Power output (P), consistent with the main plot’s x-axis (W or W·kg⁻¹).\nY-Axis: Percentage of Total Aerobic Energy Expenditure (%), ranging from 0 to 100%.\n\nCHO-Utilization (%) (Dotted Pink Line): Illustrates the relative contribution of carbohydrate oxidation to the total aerobic energy production at each power output. This typically increases with intensity.\nFat-Utilization (%) (Dotted Dark Green Line): Shows the relative contribution of fat oxidation. This typically decreases with increasing intensity, especially above Fatmax. This plot effectively visualizes the “substrate crossover” concept, which describes the shift from predominantly fat utilization at lower intensities to predominantly carbohydrate utilization at higher intensities (Brooks et al., 2004). The intersection of these two curves (if it occurs) roughly indicates the intensity where CHO and fat contribute equally to aerobic energy supply.\n\n\n\n\nValues Display Area\nLocated directly below the plot(s), this dynamic text area provides a numerical summary of key metabolic parameters calculated at two physiologically significant anchor points: FATmax and MLSS. For each of these intensity points, the following information is typically displayed:\n\nPower output (in W or W·kg⁻¹, matching the plot setting).\nSteady-state \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,SS}\\) (absolute in ml·min⁻¹ or relative in ml·min⁻¹·kg⁻¹) and also expressed as a percentage of the individual’s \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) (e.g., “MLSS at 75% \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\)”).\nRate of lactate production (\\(vLa_{SS}\\) in mmol·l⁻¹·min⁻¹).\nRate of lactate oxidation (\\(vLa_{ox}\\) in mmol·l⁻¹·min⁻¹).\nPyruvate Deficit (PD) in mmol·l⁻¹·min⁻¹.\nTheoretical Lactate Accumulation (LaAccumulation) in mmol·l⁻¹.\nIf substrate utilization is shown:\n\nAbsolute carbohydrate oxidation rate (in the units selected by the user: g/h, kcal/h, or kJ/h) and its percentage contribution to total aerobic energy.\nAbsolute fat oxidation rate (in selected units) and its percentage contribution.\nPredicted Respiratory Quotient (RQ) at that specific intensity.\n\nCalculated gross efficiency (ηgross) in %.\nCalculated net efficiency (ηnet) in %.\n\nAdditionally, if cadence dependency is active, this display area will also show the effective \\(CE\\), \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\), and, if their respective dependencies are enabled, the effective \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) and \\(vLa_{max}\\) values that correspond to the user-selected cadence. This provides full transparency on how cadence adjustments are impacting the core model parameters.",

    "text": "Tab 2: Exercise Simulation (Dynamic Model)\nThis tab allows users to move beyond steady-state assumptions and simulate the dynamic, time-dependent metabolic responses of an individual to a defined exercise protocol. This is invaluable for understanding how various physiological systems adapt and interact during non-steady-state conditions, such as those encountered in interval training, races with variable pacing, or ramp tests.\n\nControl Panel: Exercise Simulation\n\nStep Test / Exercise Simulation Parameters\nThese controls are used to define the exercise protocol for the simulation, either by generating a standard step test or by loading power data from an external file.\n\nStep Increment (Watts): If generating an incremental step test, this parameter sets the magnitude of the power increase for each successive step (e.g., an increment of 20 Watts).\nStep Duration (s): For a generated step test, this defines the duration (in seconds) of each constant-power stage (e.g., 180 seconds for 3-minute stages).\nMaximum Power (Watts): This sets the highest power output that will be targeted in a generated incremental step test. The simulation will incrementally increase power up to this level, or until an abort criterion is met.\nPower Adjustment (%): A global scaling factor (ranging from 0% to 200%) that is applied to all power values in the current workout, regardless of whether the workout was generated by the app or loaded from an external file. This allows users to easily scale a given workout to simulate higher or lower absolute intensities, for instance, to match different fitness levels or to explore the effects of relative intensity changes.\nLoad Example Exercise Data Button: Loads a pre-defined sample interval workout directly into the simulation. This sample dataset typically includes time, power, and often cadence values, providing a quick way to see the dynamic simulation in action.\nInsert workout file / File Upload:\n\nThis feature allows users to upload their own workout data from external files. Supported file formats include .csv (comma-separated values), .txt (often tab-separated, but other delimiters may be auto-detected), .xlsx (modern Excel format), and .xls (older Excel format).\nThe app expects the file to contain columns for time (or timestamp), power, and optionally, cadence. The data will be parsed and interpolated to a 1-second resolution for the simulation.\nFile has headers (Checkbox): This should be checked (it is by default) if the first row of the uploaded file contains descriptive column names (e.g., “Time”, “Power_Watts”, “Cadence_rpm”). If unchecked, the app will assume the data begins from the very first row and will attempt to use a default column order (typically Time, Power, then Cadence if present).\nUploaded workout data gap processing (Radio buttons): This option determines how the app handles missing data points or time gaps when it interpolates the uploaded data to a 1-second resolution:\n\nMaintain last values (Default): If there is a gap in the recorded data (e.g., a recording device missed a few seconds), the power output (and cadence, if available) from the last valid preceding data point will be carried forward to fill the missing seconds. This method is often preferred for visualizing structured interval training where power is intended to be constant during an interval, and brief recording dropouts should not appear as zero power.\nInsert zero values: If there is a gap, the power (and cadence) for the missing seconds will be set to zero. This method is more appropriate for analyzing training sessions that include distinct rest periods where the actual power output is indeed zero, and these rests should be accurately reflected in the simulation.\n\n\nSmooth Power Curve (5-point window) Button: When clicked, this applies a 5-point moving average filter to the currently loaded or generated power data. This can be useful for reducing noise or very rapid, short-lived fluctuations in recorded power data, providing a smoother and potentially more physiologically representative input for the metabolic simulation. Cadence data, if present, is typically smoothed with a slightly wider window (e.g., 10-point).\nDisplay Window Settings: These controls allow users to customize the visible range of the plot axes for the simulation plot without altering the underlying simulation data or the calculations themselves. This is purely a visualization tool to help focus on specific portions or aspects of the simulation.\n\nAdjust X-Axis range (Checkbox): When checked, enables manual adjustment of the time (horizontal) axis.\n\nStart Time (s) / End Time (s) (Sliders): These sliders allow the user to define the visible start and end times on the x-axis of the simulation plot. This is useful for zooming into specific phases of a long workout.\n\nAdjust Y-Axis ranges (Checkbox): When checked, enables manual adjustment of the various y-axes on the simulation plot.\n\nPower Y-Axis Maximum (Slider): Sets the maximum displayed value for the primary Y-axis (which typically shows Power, Cadence, MPA, Strain Score, and Glycogen).\n\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) Y-Axis Maximum (Slider): Sets the maximum displayed value for the tertiary Y-axis (which typically shows \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) and O₂ Deficit related variables).\nLactate Y-Axis Minimum / Maximum (Sliders): Sets the minimum and maximum displayed values for the secondary Y-axis (which typically shows Lactate, W’ Balance, PCr, pH, various rates, RQ, and HR).\n\n\n\n\n\nCadence Dependency\nThis section mirrors the functionality of Tab 1 but applies the cadence-dependent metabolic adjustments dynamically throughout the exercise simulation, based on the work of Dunst et al. (2025).\n\nEnable U-Shaped Cadence Dependency (Checkbox): If checked, metabolic parameters such as \\(CE\\) and \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) (and optionally \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) and \\(vLa_{max}\\)) will be adjusted at each time step of the simulation based on the cadence at that specific moment.\nFixed Cadence (rpm) (Slider): This value is used if “Use cadence from file” is unchecked, or if an uploaded file lacks cadence data, but cadence dependency is enabled. It sets a constant cadence that will be assumed for the entire simulation for the purpose of parameter adjustments.\nUse cadence from file (if available) (Checkbox):\n\nIf this box is checked, AND cadence data is present in an uploaded workout file, AND “Enable U-Shaped Cadence Dependency” is active, the simulation will use the time-varying cadence values directly from the file to modulate the metabolic parameters at each second.\nIf no cadence data is found in the file, or if this option is unchecked, the “Fixed Cadence” value will be used for cadence-dependent calculations if the main cadence dependency is enabled.\n\nThe specific dependencies for CE (\\(\\text{CEV̇O}_2\\)) Dependency, \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) Dependency, Include \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) Dependency, and Include vLamax Dependency can be individually toggled on or off, functioning identically to their counterparts in Tab 1, but their effects are applied dynamically based on the instantaneous cadence during the simulation.\n\n\n\nPhysiological Parameters (Dynamic Simulation)\nThese parameters are crucial for governing the kinetic (time-dependent) responses of the various metabolic and physiological systems modeled in the simulation.\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) Start (ml·min⁻¹):\n\nThis sets the initial oxygen uptake value (\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\)) at the very beginning (time = 0 seconds) of the simulation. The slider for this parameter is dynamically constrained to be between the current effective \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) (which can vary if cadence dependency is active) and the current effective \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\). The default starting value is often set to approximate the \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) that would be observed at the Fatmax intensity (as determined in Tab 1). This assumes the exercise often starts from a low-intensity active baseline rather than complete, supine rest. This initial \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) value significantly influences the calculation of the initial oxygen deficit.\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,on}\\) time constant (τon) (s):\n\nThis parameter defines the characteristic speed of the exponential rise of \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) towards its new, higher target (steady-state) value whenever exercise intensity increases or exercise begins from a lower baseline. A smaller τon value indicates faster “on” kinetics, meaning \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) reaches its target more quickly. Typical values for τon in healthy individuals during moderate intensity exercise range from about 20 seconds in highly trained athletes to 40 seconds or more in less trained or older individuals (Barstow & Mole, 1991; Whipp & Wasserman, 1972). The fundamental equation describing an exponential rise to a new steady state is often given as: \\[ \\dot{V}O_2(t) = \\dot{V}O_{2,initial} + (\\dot{V}O_{2,target} - \\dot{V}O_{2,initial}) \\cdot (1 - e^{-(t - t_{delay})/\\tau_{on}}) \\] Where \\(t_{delay}\\) is the initial time delay (see below). The app implements this step-wise.\nIntensity-Dependent τon (Checkbox):\n\nIf this option is checked, τon is not a single fixed value for all upward transitions. Instead, it is dynamically calculated for each second of the simulation based on the \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) (expressed as a percentage of the current \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\)) of the immediately preceding time step. The underlying base formula is \\(\\tau_{on\\_base} = 0.38 \\cdot \\text{PreviousIntensity%} + 6\\) seconds. The slider value for τon then acts as the specific τon that would occur if the preceding intensity was exactly 50% of \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\). This means the slider effectively sets an offset to this formula, allowing the user to shift the entire linear τon-intensity relationship. This feature aims to simulate the physiological observation that \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) on-kinetics can be slower if an exercise bout is initiated from an already elevated metabolic rate (e.g., due to prior high-intensity work or insufficient recovery).\n\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,off}\\) time constant (τoff) (s):\n\nThis parameter defines the characteristic speed of the exponential fall of \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) towards its new, lower target value when exercise intensity decreases or during recovery periods. Off-kinetics can be similar to, or often slightly slower than, on-kinetics, particularly following high-intensity or prolonged exercise, due to factors like elevated body temperature, hormone levels, and the metabolic cost of recovery processes (Özyener et al., 2001).\nIntensity-Dependent τoff (Checkbox):\n\nIf checked, τoff is also dynamically calculated. Its value depends on the maximum \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) (as % of current \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\)) achieved within a recent lookback window (typically defined as twice the duration of the previous step’s τoff value). The base formula used is \\(\\tau_{off\\_base} = 0.45 \\cdot \\text{Intensity%} + 10\\) seconds. Similar to the dynamic τon, the slider value for τoff sets the τoff for a reference 50% intensity, thereby shifting this relationship. This models the physiological reality that recovery of \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) might be faster after lower intensity efforts and slower after higher intensity efforts which cause greater metabolic disturbance and a larger oxygen debt.\n\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) Response Delay (s):\n\nThis represents a pure time delay (in seconds) before the exponential \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) response (either “on” or “off” kinetics) actually begins following a change in power output. This delay accounts for physiological lags such as the circulatory transit time of blood from the lungs to the exercising muscles (for O₂ delivery) and from muscles to lungs (for CO₂ feedback influencing ventilation), as well as any initial inertia in muscular metabolic pathway activation (Lamarra et al., 1987). The default is 2 seconds, with a typical physiological range considered to be 0-10 seconds. This delay directly affects the timing of the actual \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) change, the calculation of O₂ deficit/surplus, and subsequently the modeled rate of lactate oxidation (\\(vLa_{ox}\\)).\n\nLactate exercise termination value (mmol·l⁻¹):\n\nIf the “Terminate simulation when lactate exceeds max value” checkbox (see below) is active, the simulation will automatically stop if the modeled blood lactate concentration reaches this specified threshold. Values around 20 mmol/l represent very high, often exhaustive, levels of lactate accumulation.\n\nTerminate simulation when lactate exceeds max value (Checkbox): Enables or disables the lactate-based abortion criterion for the simulation.\nResting Lactate-value (mmol·l⁻¹):\n\nThe initial blood lactate concentration assumed at the start (time = 0s) of the simulation. Typical resting values in healthy individuals are around 0.5 to 1.5 mmol/l.\n\nvLaSS,on Time Constant (τvLaSS,on) (s):\n\nThe time constant governing the exponential rise of the actual lactate production rate (\\(vLa_{SS}\\)) towards its new, higher target value when exercise intensity increases. This parameter reflects how quickly the glycolytic flux adapts upwards in response to increased energy demand.\n\nvLaSS,off Time Constant (τvLaSS,off) (s):\n\nThe time constant governing the exponential fall of \\(vLa_{SS}\\) towards its new, lower target value when exercise intensity decreases or during recovery periods. This reflects the downregulation of glycolysis.\n\nvLaSS Response Delay (s):\n\nA pure time delay (in seconds) before the lactate production rate (\\(vLa_{SS}\\)) begins its exponential kinetic response (either upwards or downwards) to a change in exercise intensity. This simulates inherent biochemical delays in the activation or deactivation of the complex glycolytic pathway.\n\nCap vLass by \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) Deficit (Checkbox):\n\nAn optional, advanced physiological constraint. If this box is checked, the actual lactate production rate (\\(vLa_{SS}\\)) at any given time point during the simulation is capped. The cap is determined such that the net anaerobic energy supply (which is derived from the energy equivalent of lactate production minus the energy equivalent of concurrent lactate oxidation) does not exceed the current calculated oxygen deficit (which, in turn, is \\(\\dot{V}O_2 \\text{ Demand} - \\dot{V}O_2 \\text{ Actual}\\)). The purpose of this option is to enhance physiological plausibility by preventing an unrealistic “overshoot” of anaerobic energy production, especially during transitions where aerobic energy supply is still ramping up or is limited. When unchecked (default), \\(vLa_{SS}\\) is determined purely by its own kinetic parameters without this specific energy balance cap.\n\nMuscle pH (pHm) Simulation (Informational text & underlying mechanism):\n\nThis feature simulates changes in intramuscular pH (pHm), a critical factor in muscle function and fatigue. The calculation of pHm is based on established physiological principles, drawing from the work of Mader (2003) and further elaborated in texts such as Heck et al. (2022). The model considers several key intracellular factors that influence pHm:\n\nEstimated inorganic phosphate concentration ([Pi]): [Pi] increases as phosphocreatine ([PCr]) is broken down, and high [Pi] can contribute to acidosis. The model estimates [Pi] inversely based on the current [PCr].\nIntramuscular lactate concentration ([La]m): The accumulation of lactate is stoichiometrically linked with the production of H⁺ ions, thus directly impacting pHm. The model uses its dynamically calculated intramuscular lactate.\nEstimated arterial partial pressure of CO₂ (pCO₂): pCO₂ influences the carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer system within the muscle. The model estimates pCO₂ as increasing with relative exercise intensity (i.e., %\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\)), reflecting increased metabolic CO₂ production and ventilatory responses.\n\nThe critical aspect of this feature is the feedback loop: the pHm calculated from the previous time step is then used to modulate the effective maximal lactate production rate (\\(vLa_{max,eff}\\)) for the current time step. This modulation simulates the well-known inhibitory effect of falling (more acidic) pH on key glycolytic enzymes, particularly phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is a major rate-limiting step in glycolysis (Danforth, 1965). The relationship is typically sigmoidal, represented in the app as:\\[vLa_{max,eff} = vLa_{max,base} \\cdot \\text{PFK Activity Factor}(pH_m)\\] Where PFK_Activity_Factor(pHm) is a term that decreases (from a maximum of ~1.0 down to near 0) as pHm drops significantly below physiological resting levels (e.g., below pH ~7.0 down towards pH 6.0).\nThis pH-modulated \\(vLa_{max,eff}\\) then becomes the new input for determining the target \\(vLa_{SS}\\) for the current time step. This creates a physiologically relevant negative feedback loop: high rates of lactate production can lead to a drop in pHm, which in turn can reduce further lactate production by inhibiting PFK, thus helping to limit excessive acidosis.\n\n\n\n\nGlycogen Storage Parameters\nThis section of the control panel models the dynamics of muscle glycogen stores, a critical fuel source for prolonged and high-intensity exercise. The model simulates depletion due to carbohydrate oxidation and potential repletion from exogenous carbohydrate intake.\n\nAuto-calculate glycogen values based on muscle mass (Checkbox):\n\nIf this box is checked, the “Initial Glycogen Storage” and “Maximum Glycogen Storage” slider values are automatically populated. This calculation is based on the “Active Muscle Mass” value (derived from the PCr model settings) or, if that’s not explicitly set, an estimation from total body mass. The calculation assumes typical physiological glycogen concentrations in muscle tissue, for instance, around 15 grams of glycogen per kilogram of active muscle for normal, fed states, and perhaps up to 20-25 g/kg for carbohydrate-loaded (“supercompensated”) states.\n\nInitial Glycogen Storage (g) (Slider):\n\nSets the amount of glycogen (in grams) assumed to be available in the active muscle mass at the very beginning of the simulation. Typical values for well-nourished and trained athletes range from 350-500g, but can be higher with specific carbohydrate loading strategies (Åstrand et al., 2003; Bergström et al., 1967; Murray & Rosenbloom, 2018).\n\nMaximum Glycogen Storage (g) (Slider):\n\nDefines the physiological upper limit for glycogen storage within the active muscle mass. Even with carbohydrate intake during exercise, the glycogen stores will not replete beyond this set maximum.\n\nCarbohydrate Intake Rate (g·h⁻¹):\n\nSets the rate (in grams per hour) at which exogenous carbohydrates (e.g., from sports drinks or gels) are ingested and become available for either direct oxidation by the muscles or for glycogen synthesis (if stores are depleted and conditions allow). Typical maximal exogenous CHO oxidation rates are often cited in the range of 60-90 g/h for single-source carbohydrates like glucose or maltodextrin (Jeukendrup & Wallis, 2005; A. Jeukendrup & Gleeson, 2019). Combinations of multiple transportable carbohydrates (e.g., glucose and fructose) can increase this to 120g/h or even slightly more (Jeukendrup, 2010).\n\n\nThe model calculates glycogen depletion based on the instantaneous rate of carbohydrate oxidation. The CHO oxidation rate itself is derived dynamically at each time step from the balance of \\(vLa_{SS}\\) and \\(vLa_{ox}\\) (as in Tab 1), but applied kinetically over time. If the modeled glycogen stores reach zero, this can trigger a simulation abortion if that termination criterion is implicitly or explicitly active (e.g., inability to maintain power due to substrate depletion).\n\n\nW’ Balance Parameters\nThis section implements a model for W’ (pronounced “W prime”), a concept central to understanding exercise tolerance above a certain metabolic threshold known as Critical Power (CP). W’ represents a finite amount of work that can be performed when exercising at intensities greater than CP (Monod & Scherrer, 1965; Poole et al., 2016; Skiba et al., 2012). Depletion of W’ is closely associated with the onset of severe fatigue and task failure.\n\nCritical Power (CP) (W) (Slider):\n\nDefines the Critical Power, which is, in theory, the highest power output that can be sustained for a very long time without a progressive loss of homeostasis or depletion of W’. It represents a critical metabolic threshold demarcating sustainable from unsustainable exercise intensities.\n\nW’ (kJ) (Slider):\n\nRepresents the total amount of work (expressed in kilojoules) that can be performed above CP before W’ is considered fully depleted. It reflects a combination of anaerobic energy capacity and tolerance for the accumulation of fatigue-related metabolites. Typical W’ values range from 10 to 30 kJ, depending on the individual’s training status and physiological profile.\n\nPmax (W) (Slider):\n\nRepresents the maximum instantaneous power an athlete can produce, typically observed during very short, all-out sprints (e.g., lasting a few seconds). This parameter is integral to the 3-parameter critical power model (which includes Pmax, CP, and W’) and is specifically used in this app for calculating MPA (Maximum Power Available) and the Strain Score (SS). These metrics draw on concepts from researchers like Hauser et al. (2014) and potentially more recent work like Kontro et al. (2025, though not in the provided citation list, the formulas in the HTML align with this type of model). Pmax is considered to represent the power capacity of the alactic (phosphagen/immediate) energy system.\n\nUse MLSS from Tab 1 as CP (Checkbox):\n\nIf checked (this is the default state), the CP value for the Tab 2 simulation is automatically set to be equal to the Maximal Lactate Steady State (MLSS) power output calculated in Tab 1. The CP slider below then becomes disabled, but will display this MLSS value. This option provides a physiologically grounded and individually determined estimate for CP, as MLSS and CP are often found to be closely related, though not always identical (Poole et al., 2016).\n\nW’ Balance Minimum (kJ) (Slider):\n\nAllows the user to define a lower threshold for W’ balance. This can be set to zero (meaning exhaustion occurs when W’ is fully depleted) or even to a negative value, which some models propose might represent a “digging deeper” capacity, though this is less common. The default in the app is -10 kJ.\n\nAbort simulation when W’ Balance falls below slider minimum (Checkbox):\n\nIf checked (default state), the simulation will automatically terminate if the calculated W’BAL (W’ balance) drops below the value specified by the “W’ Balance Minimum” slider.\n\n\nW’ Balance Model Dynamics: The app models W’ balance dynamics based on established principles ((Morton, 2008; Skiba et al., 2012) for general energy system concepts):\n\nDuring exercise at power outputs (P) greater than CP (P &gt; CP), W’ depletes linearly with the work done above CP: \\[ W'_{BAL}(t) = W'_{BAL}(previous\\_t) - (P - CP) \\cdot \\Delta t \\] where \\(W'_{BAL}(t)\\) is W’ balance at current time \\(t\\), \\(W'_{BAL}(previous\\_t)\\) is W’ balance at the previous time step, and \\(\\Delta t\\) is the time interval (1 second in this app).\nDuring exercise at power outputs (P) less than CP (P &lt; CP), W’ recovers exponentially: The rate and extent of W’ recovery depend on the magnitude of the difference between CP and the recovery power (\\(D_{CP} = CP - P_{recovery}\\)) and the total W’ capacity. A common formulation for W’ recovery is: \\[ W'_{BAL}(t) = W'_0 - (W'_0 - W'_{BAL}(previous\\_t)) \\cdot e^{-(D_{CP}/W'_0) \\cdot \\Delta t} \\] where \\(W'_0\\) is the initial (full) W’ capacity.\n\nThe MPA & Strain Score (SS) model, which is also displayed in the plot and summary, uses Pmax and the current W’ balance to provide novel metrics of fatigue and available power. The formulas used in the app’s HTML for MPA and SS are consistent with recent research by Kontro et al. (2025).\n\nMPA (Maximum Power Available): The highest power output theoretically achievable at any given moment, considering the current W’ depletion. \\[ MPA = P_{max} - (P_{max} - CP) \\cdot (W'_{EXP}/W')^2 \\] where \\(W'_{EXP}\\) is the amount of W’ expended (\\(W'_0 - W'_{BAL}\\)).\nkstrain (Strain Coefficient): A factor that modulates the perceived or physiological strain based on the current power output relative to MPA and CP. \\[ k_{strain} = (P_{max} - MPA + CP)/(P_{max} - P + CP) \\]\nSR (Strain Rate): The instantaneous rate at which strain is accumulating. \\[ SR = k_{strain} \\cdot P \\]\nSS (Strain Score): The cumulative strain experienced over the exercise bout. \\[ SS = \\sum(SR \\cdot \\Delta t) \\cdot (\\text{NormalizationFactor}) \\] The Normalization Factor, which appears to be \\((P_{max}/CP^2) \\cdot (100/3600)\\) in the app, scales the score. For instance, a common scaling aims for 1 hour of exercise at CP to yield an SS of 100.\n\n\n\nPCr and O₂ Deficit Model\nThis section of the control panel enables the simulation of phosphocreatine (PCr) dynamics within the active muscle and the associated oxygen deficit that is incurred at the onset of exercise or during transitions to higher exercise intensities. PCr is a crucial high-energy phosphate compound that provides ATP rapidly at the start of muscle contraction before oxidative phosphorylation can fully activate.\n\nResting PCr (mmol·kg⁻¹ wet muscle weight) (Slider):\n\nSets the initial concentration of PCr in the active muscle tissue at the beginning of the simulation. Typical physiological values in healthy, rested human skeletal muscle range from about 15 to 38 mmol·kg⁻¹ wet weight (R. C. Harris et al., 1976; Karlsson, 1971). Training status and muscle fiber type can influence this.\n\nP/O₂ (mol ATP · mol O₂⁻¹) (Slider):\n\nRepresents the P/O₂ ratio, which is the stoichiometry of oxidative phosphorylation: the number of moles of ATP synthesized per mole of diatomic oxygen (O₂) reduced in the mitochondria. This value is not absolutely constant but depends on the substrate being oxidized (e.g., carbohydrates vs. fats) and the coupling efficiency of the electron transport chain. It is generally accepted to be around 2.3-2.5 (or 4.6-5.0 if O refers to O₂, not O atom) when considering NADH and FADH₂ contributions. The app’s range (4.61 for pure fat to 5.0 for pure CHO) reflects O₂ (diatomic oxygen).\n\nActive Muscle Mass (kg) (Slider):\n\nSets the estimated mass (in kilograms) of the skeletal muscle actively involved in performing the cycling exercise. This is a critical parameter because PCr concentrations are typically expressed per kg of muscle mass, and the total PCr pool available is thus dependent on this value. The tooltip in the app provides research-based estimates for active muscle mass in cyclists (e.g., for male cyclists, ~27% of total body weight for seated cycling, potentially increasing to ~31.5% for standing cycling, drawing from MRI data like Janssen et al. (2000) and general exercise physiology considerations).\n\nO₂-Lactate Equiv. (β) (Informational Display Only):\n\nThis is displayed as a constant value of approximately 3.0 ml O₂·kg⁻¹ body mass·mM⁻¹ blood lactate. This represents the “oxygen equivalent of lactate accumulation,” signifying the amount of O₂ (in ml per kg of body mass) that would have been required aerobically to produce the energy equivalent to accumulating 1 mM of lactate in the blood. This concept, extensively detailed by Di Prampero (1981), is used in the model to help partition the overall O₂ deficit into components covered by PCr breakdown and by net lactate production.\n\nShow \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) Demand Curve (Checkbox):\n\nIf checked, the simulation plot will include an additional trace representing the theoretical, instantaneous \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) demand required to meet the energy cost of the current power output if metabolism could respond infinitely fast. The area between this demand curve and the actual (kinetically-limited) \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) curve visually represents the accumulated oxygen deficit (when demand &gt; uptake) or oxygen surplus (during recovery when uptake &gt; demand).\n\n\nPCr Model Dynamics: The simulation models changes in the PCr store based on the dynamic balance between O₂ demand and actual O₂ uptake:\n\nPCr Depletion: When \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) demand (calculated from the current power output using the steady-state P-\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) relationship) exceeds the actual \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) uptake (which is kinetically limited), an oxygen deficit occurs. A portion of the energy required to cover this deficit is supplied by the net breakdown of PCr to rapidly resynthesize ATP (PCr + ADP + H⁺ ↔︎ ATP + Cr). The amount of PCr consumed is proportional to this O₂ deficit portion that is not covered by immediate glycolysis, scaled by the P/O₂ ratio (which converts O₂ deficit to ATP equivalents).\\[ \\Delta PCr_{consumed} \\propto (\\text{O2\\_deficit\\_allocated\\_to\\_PCr}) \\cdot (P/O_2 \\text{ ratio}) \\]\nPCr Resynthesis: When actual \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) uptake exceeds the current \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) demand (creating an O₂ surplus, e.g., during recovery periods or when exercise intensity decreases significantly), PCr is resynthesized from creatine and ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation. This process itself consumes ATP (and thus oxygen) and is modeled as being proportional to the O₂ surplus available for PCr resynthesis, again scaled by the P/O₂ ratio. The app’s code includes a pcrResynthesisFactor (set to 0.5), implying that only a portion of the O₂ surplus is directed towards PCr resynthesis, with the rest potentially contributing to other recovery processes. \\[ \\Delta PCr_{resynthesized} \\propto (\\text{O2\\_surplus} \\cdot \\text{pcrResynthesisFactor}) \\cdot (P/O_2 \\text{ ratio}) \\] The accumulated O₂ deficit represents the total integrated difference between oxygen demand and oxygen uptake from the start of exercise. It reflects the cumulative reliance on anaerobic energy sources (PCr hydrolysis and anaerobic glycolysis leading to lactate production) to meet the energy demands not immediately covered by aerobic metabolism. The kinetics of PCr are often faster than those of \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) (McCann et al., 1995).\n\n\n\nModel Parameters (for Tab 2 Simulation)\nThis section provides the user with flexibility in defining the core physiological parameters for the dynamic simulation. The user can either link these parameters directly to those defined in Tab 1 (P-V̇O₂-La Dynamics) or set them independently for the simulation.\n\nUse model parameters from Tab 1 (Checkbox):\n\nChecked (Default State): When this box is checked, the fundamental physiological parameters for the Tab 2 simulation—including \\(CE\\) (or \\(CE_{Start}\\)/\\(CE_{Target}\\) if curvilinear), \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\), \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\), \\(vLa_{max}\\), Body Mass, and all HR-related parameters (HRmax, HRBase, CEHR), as well as the curvilinear CE setting—are directly mirrored from their current values in Tab 1. The individual parameter sliders located below this checkbox in the “Individual Parameters” section will then become disabled (greyed out) but will visually reflect the values being imported from Tab 1. This is the recommended approach if the user wants to simulate the dynamic responses of an individual whose steady-state profile has already been established or explored in Tab 1. Any subsequent changes made to these parameters in Tab 1 will automatically propagate to these linked parameters in Tab 2, ensuring consistency.\nUnchecked: If this box is unchecked, the linkage to Tab 1 is broken. The individual parameter sliders in the “Individual Parameters” section (detailed below) become active, allowing the user to define a completely independent set of physiological parameters specifically for the Tab 2 simulation. This is useful if one wants to explore hypothetical scenarios or simulate an individual with a different profile without altering the settings in Tab 1.\n\nIndividual Parameter Sliders (within the “Individual Parameters” collapsible section): These sliders are active only if “Use model parameters from Tab 1” is unchecked. They allow for independent setting of:\n\nCurvilinear CE relationship (Checkbox): Toggles between linear and curvilinear P-\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) models for the simulation.\nCE (ml·min⁻¹·W⁻¹) (Slider): For the linear CE model.\nCEStart / CETarget (ml·min⁻¹·W⁻¹) (Sliders): For the curvilinear CE model.\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) (ml·min⁻¹) (Slider)\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) (ml·min⁻¹) (Slider)\nvLamax (mmol·l⁻¹·s⁻¹) (Slider)\nBody Mass (kg) (Slider)\nHRmax (bpm) (Slider)\nHRBase (bpm) (Slider)\nCEHR (bpm·W⁻¹) (Slider) These function identically to their counterparts in Tab 1 but only affect the Tab 2 simulation when the link to Tab 1 is disabled.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise Simulation Plot (Tab 2)\nThis is a dynamic, multi-trace plot that visualizes various simulated physiological and performance parameters over the time course of the defined exercise protocol. It allows for a comprehensive view of how different systems respond and interact.\n\nX-Axis: Time (in seconds). The range of this axis can be manually adjusted using the “Display Window Settings” in the sidebar to focus on specific periods of the simulation.\nPrimary Y-Axis (Left side of plot - typically denoted as y): This axis displays parameters primarily related to power output, mechanical aspects of movement, and some physiological stores.\n\nPower (W) (Dark Grey Line): The instantaneous power output of the simulated exercise protocol at each second.\nCadence (rpm) (Light Grey Dashed Line): Displayed if cadence data is available (either from a loaded file when “Use cadence from file” is active, or the fixed cadence value if cadence dependency is enabled without file data).\nMPA (W) (Dark Grey-Blue Dashed Line): Maximum Power Available, a dynamic value calculated from the W’ balance model and Pmax, representing the highest power output theoretically achievable at that moment.\nStrain Score (Unitless) (Pink Line): The cumulative Strain Score, reflecting the integrated physiological strain based on the MPA model.\nGlycogen Stores (g) (Dark Pink Dotted Line): The modeled content of glycogen in the active muscle mass, showing depletion during exercise and potential repletion if carbohydrate intake is simulated.\n\nSecondary Y-Axis (Right side of plot - typically y2): This axis is designed to display a variety of scaled parameters, often with different units, requiring careful interpretation of their respective scales. It commonly includes:\n\nW’ Balance (kJ) (Green Line): The current remaining W’ balance.\nLactate (Muscle) (mM) (Dark Red Line): Modeled intramuscular lactate concentration.\nLactate (Blood) (mM) (Dark Red Dotted Line): Modeled blood lactate concentration, typically from a two-compartment model (muscle and blood/other tissues).\nvLaSS (mM/min) (Red Dashed Line): The instantaneous rate of lactate production (converted from mmol·l⁻¹·s⁻¹).\nvLaox (mM/min) (Light Blue Dashed Line): The instantaneous rate of lactate oxidation/elimination.\nPD (Pyruvate Deficit) (mM/min) (Purple Line): The dynamic difference \\(vLa_{ox} - vLa_{SS}\\).\nPCr Store (mM/kg) (Yellow Dotted Line): Modeled phosphocreatine concentration in the active muscle.\npHm (Unitless) (Orange Dotted Line): Modeled intramuscular pH.\nRQpredicted ⋅ 10 (Unitless) (Yellow-Orange Dashed Line): The kinetically-smoothed predicted Respiratory Quotient, scaled by a factor of 10 for better visibility on this shared axis (actual RQ values typically range from 0.7 to 1.0, potentially slightly higher during very intense exercise).\nHeart Rate ⋅ 10⁻¹ (bpm) (Dark Red Dotted Line): The simulated heart rate, scaled by a factor of 0.1 for plotting convenience (e.g., a heart rate of 150 bpm would be plotted at a Y-value of 15).\nZero Line (Thin Grey Dotted Line): A horizontal reference line at y=0 for this axis, useful for interpreting parameters like PD or W’ balance relative to baseline.\n\nTertiary Y-Axis (Right side, typically positioned further out - y3): This axis is dedicated to displaying oxygen uptake parameters.\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) (ml/min) (Blue Line): The actual, kinetically-determined oxygen uptake at each second of the simulation.\n\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) Demand (ml/min) (Blue Dotted Line): (Visible if “Show \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) Demand Curve” is checked in the PCr model settings) The theoretical instantaneous \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) that would be required to meet the energy cost of the current power output if metabolic processes could respond infinitely fast.\nO₂ Deficit Area (Light Blue Filled Area): (Visible if the \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) Demand curve is shown) The shaded area between the \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) Demand curve and the actual \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) curve. This visually represents the accumulated oxygen deficit (when demand &gt; uptake) or oxygen surplus (during recovery phases when uptake &gt; demand).\nAcc. O₂ Deficit (ml) (Cyan Dotted Line): The cumulative net oxygen deficit (Total O2 Demand - Total O2 Uptake) over time.\n\n\nUsers can interact with the plot legend by clicking on trace names. This action toggles the visibility of the corresponding trace on the plot, allowing users to focus on specific parameters of interest or to declutter the view. If the simulation is terminated prematurely due to one of the set abort conditions (e.g., lactate exceeding threshold, W’ balance dropping below minimum, glycogen depletion, or complete PCr depletion), an annotation will typically appear on the plot marking the point and reason for termination.\n\n\nExercise Summary Statistics (Tab 2)\nLocated below the simulation plot, this section provides a detailed quantitative summary of the entire simulated exercise session, offering insights into overall workload, energy expenditure, fuel utilization, and various performance metrics.\n\nAverage mechanical Power (W): The time-weighted average of the power output over the duration of the simulation.\nNormalized mechanical Power (W): A power averaging method designed to provide a more physiologically relevant measure of training stress than simple average power, especially for workouts with variable intensity. It typically involves calculating a 30-second rolling average of power, raising these values to the 4th power, averaging these transformed values, and then taking the 4th root of that average. This gives more weight to higher intensity portions.\nTotal Aerobic Energy Expenditure (kcal): The gross (total) energy expended via aerobic pathways throughout the entire simulation. This is calculated from the integral of the \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) curve over time, converted to energy units using an average caloric equivalent for oxygen (derived from the average predicted RQ over the session).\nTotal mechanical Work (kJ): The sum of (Power × time_interval) for all 1-second intervals of the simulation, converted to kilojoules. This represents the total external work performed.\nTotal metabolic Work (kJ): The sum of the net energy contributions from the three major energy systems: net aerobic metabolism, anaerobic-lactic metabolism, and anaerobic-alactic metabolism. This represents the total energy turnover above resting levels required to perform the exercise.\n\nAerobic contribution (kJ | %): The energy derived from net aerobic metabolism. This is calculated by integrating the actual \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) curve, subtracting the integrated energy cost equivalent to maintaining \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) for the duration, and converting the net O₂ consumed to kJ. The percentage is relative to the Total Metabolic Work.\nAnaerobic-lactic contribution (kJ | %): The energy derived from net lactate production. This is estimated from the O₂ equivalent of gross lactate production (calculated from the integrated \\(vLa_{SS}\\) kinetics), using factors like the β-coefficient (O₂-Lactate Equiv.) to convert lactate changes into energy equivalents.\nAnaerobic-alactic contribution (kJ | %): The energy derived from the net breakdown of phosphocreatine (PCr). This is estimated from the O₂ equivalent of the total PCr utilized during the exercise bout, based on the P/O₂ ratio.\n\nηgross (%): Overall gross efficiency for the entire session, calculated as: \\[ \\eta_{gross} = (\\text{Total Mechanical Work [kJ]}) / (\\text{Total Gross Aerobic Energy Expenditure [kJ]}) \\times 100\\% \\]\nηnet (%): Overall net efficiency for the entire session, calculated as: \\[ \\eta_{net} = (\\text{Total Mechanical Work [kJ]}) / (\\text{Net Aerobic Energy Expenditure [kJ]}) \\times 100\\% \\] Where net aerobic energy expenditure excludes the energy cost associated with maintaining \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\).\nηtotal (%): Overall total efficiency, considering all energy pathways in the denominator: \\[ \\eta_{total} = (\\text{Total Mechanical Work [kJ]}) / (\\text{Total Metabolic Work [kJ]}) \\times 100\\% \\]\nWork &gt; CP (mechanical) (kJ): The total amount of mechanical work (in kJ) performed during periods where the instantaneous power output was above the set Critical Power (CP).\nW’ Balance Drop (kJ): The difference between the initial W’ value (at the start of the simulation) and the minimum W’ balance reached at any point during the exercise.\nTotal Carbohydrate Utilization (g): The total mass of carbohydrates (in grams) estimated to have been oxidized during the simulation, based on the integrated CHO oxidation rate.\nTotal Fat Utilization (g): The total mass of fats (in grams) estimated to have been oxidized during the simulation.\nTraining Stress Score (TSS): An estimation of the overall training load or stress imposed by the simulated workout. It is typically calculated using Normalized Power, the duration of the exercise, and the individual’s Functional Threshold Power (FTP), for which the app uses the set Critical Power (CP) as a proxy. A common formula is: \\[ TSS = (\\text{Duration in seconds} \\cdot \\text{Normalized Power} \\cdot \\text{Intensity Factor}) / (\\text{FTP} \\cdot 3600) \\cdot 100 \\] Where Intensity Factor (IF) = Normalized Power / FTP.\nStrain Score (SS): The total cumulative Strain Score accumulated during the simulation, based on the model by Hauser et al. (2014) and Kontro et al. (as per HTML formulas), which considers Pmax, CP, and W’ dynamics.\n\nSSCP: The component of the total Strain Score attributed to work performed at or below CP.\nSSW’: The component of the total Strain Score attributed to the utilization of W’ (work above CP).\nSSPmax: The component of the total Strain Score attributed to very high power outputs that draw upon the Pmax capacity.\n\n\nThis comprehensive suite of tools, visualizations, and summary statistics offers a powerful platform for students, coaches, athletes, and researchers to explore, understand, and quantify the complex interplay of metabolic processes during various forms of exercise.",

    "text": "Tab 1: P-V̇O₂-La Dynamics (Steady-State Model)\nThis section delves into the metabolic responses assuming the physiological system has reached equilibrium at each evaluated power output.\n\nControl Panel: P-V̇O₂-La Dynamics\nThe sidebar on the left houses the control groups for adjusting the model parameters specifically for this steady-state analysis.\n\nOxygen Demand Settings\nThis critical section defines the fundamental relationship between mechanical power output (P, in Watts) and the corresponding steady-state oxygen uptake (\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,SS}\\), in ml·min⁻¹).\n\nCurvilinear CE relationship: This checkbox toggles between two models for the P-\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) relationship.\n\nLinear Model (Unchecked - Default): Assumes a constant oxygen cost per unit of work above \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\). The relationship is defined as: \\[ \\dot{V}O_{2,SS} = CE \\cdot P + \\dot{V}O_{2,Base} \\] Here, \\(CE\\) (Cost of Exercise) represents the slope \\(\\Delta\\dot{V}O_2 / \\Delta P\\), and \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) is the y-intercept, representing oxygen uptake during unloaded cycling.\nCurvilinear Model (Checked): Implements a quadratic relationship, acknowledging that mechanical efficiency often decreases at higher exercise intensities, leading to a disproportional increase in \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) for a given increment in power. The formula used is: \\[ \\dot{V}O_{2,SS} = a \\cdot P^2 + CE_{Start} \\cdot P + \\dot{V}O_{2,Base} \\] \\(CE_{Start}\\) is the initial slope (efficiency) at low power outputs. The coefficient \\(a\\) is automatically calculated by the application to ensure that the slope of this curve at the point where \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,SS}\\) intersects \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) matches the user-defined \\(CE_{Target}\\).\n\nCE (ml·min⁻¹·W⁻¹): (Visible and active for the Linear model)\n\nThis slider sets the constant Cost of Exercise (\\(CE\\)). Typical physiological values range from 8 to 15 ml·min⁻¹·W⁻¹. Lower values indicate higher gross mechanical efficiency for the work performed.\nDelta Efficiency (Δη): This derived metric is calculated from the \\(CE\\) value and the caloric equivalent of oxygen. Since the caloric equivalent varies with the Respiratory Quotient (RQ) (from approx. 19.6 kJ·l⁻¹ for pure fat to 21.1 kJ·l⁻¹ for pure CHO, Stegemann (1991)), Δη is presented as a range (e.g., 24.7-26.5%). It represents the efficiency of converting metabolic energy into mechanical work above resting metabolism (i.e., \\(1 / ((CE \\cdot \\text{caloric_equivalent}) / 60)\\)).\nηgross (Fatmax | MLSS): Gross efficiency is the ratio of mechanical work performed (Power output in Watts) to the total aerobic energy expenditure (also converted to Watts). This app calculates and displays ηgross at two physiologically relevant power outputs:\n\nFatmax: The power output associated with the maximal rate of fat oxidation.\nMLSS (Maximal Lactate Steady State): The highest power output that can be sustained with stable blood lactate concentrations. The predicted RQ at these intensities is used to determine the specific caloric equivalent for oxygen in these calculations.\n\nηnet (Fatmax | MLSS): Net efficiency is similar to gross efficiency but considers only the aerobic energy expenditure above the resting (or \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\)) level: \\(\\eta_{net} = (\\text{Power output}) / (\\text{Aerobic energy expenditure} - \\text{Resting energy expenditure})\\). This often yields higher efficiency values as it excludes the metabolic cost of basic bodily functions. Calculated at Fatmax and MLSS using predicted RQs.\n\nCEStart (ml·min⁻¹·W⁻¹): (Visible and active for the Curvilinear model)\n\nSets the initial slope of the \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\)-P curve, representing the oxygen cost at very low power outputs.\n\nCETarget (ml·min⁻¹·W⁻¹): (Visible and active for the Curvilinear model)\n\nSets the target slope of the \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\)-P curve specifically at the power output corresponding to \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\). This helps define the “tail-up” of the curvilinear response.\n\n\n\n\nCadence Dependency\nThis section allows for the incorporation of cycling cadence effects on the \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\)-P relationship, primarily based on the models proposed by Dunst et al. (2025). The general observation is a U-shaped relationship where metabolic efficiency is optimal at a certain cadence range, with increased oxygen cost at very low or very high cadences.\n\nEnable U-Shaped Cadence Dependency:\n\nWhen checked, the \\(CE\\), \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\), and optionally \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) and \\(vLa_{max}\\) parameters are dynamically adjusted based on the selected cadence.\n\nCadence (rpm):\n\nSlider to set the cycling cadence (revolutions per minute). The default is 80 rpm, often near optimal for many cyclists.\n\nCE-Dependency: (Automatically applied if cadence dependency is enabled)\n\nThe Cost of Exercise (\\(CE\\)) becomes a function of cadence, calculated using the formula from Dunst et al. (2025): \\(CE(rpm) = 0.0004 \\cdot rpm^2 - 0.094 \\cdot rpm + 16.857\\).\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) Dependency: (Automatically applied if cadence dependency is enabled)\n\nBaseline oxygen uptake (\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\)) also varies with cadence according to Dunst et al. (2025): \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}(rpm) = 0.172 \\cdot rpm^2 - 14.460 \\cdot rpm + 548.039\\).\n\nInclude \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) Dependency:\n\nIf checked, \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) is also modeled as cadence-dependent. This feature is noted as experimental and is qualitatively based on figures suggesting optimal \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) around 80-90 rpm (Dunst et al. (2025)).\n\nInclude vLamax Dependency:\n\nIf checked, the maximal rate of lactate production (vLamax) is adjusted based on cadence using the formula from Dunst et al. (2025): \\(vLa_{max}(rpm) = -0.0002 \\cdot rpm^2 + 0.00931 \\cdot rpm\\). It’s worth noting that Dunst et al. (2025) suggest this observed dependency might be more related to testing methodology limitations than purely physiological changes in glycolytic capacity.\n\n\n\n\nPhysiological Input-Parameters\nThese are fundamental physiological characteristics defining the simulated individual’s metabolic profile.\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) (ml·min⁻¹):\n\nMaximal oxygen uptake, a key indicator of aerobic fitness, representing the upper ceiling for aerobic ATP resynthesis.\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) (ml·min⁻¹·kg⁻¹):\n\nMaximal oxygen uptake expressed relative to body mass. This value is dynamically linked to the absolute \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) and the Body Mass slider. Modifying one will automatically update the other.\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) (ml·min⁻¹):\n\nOxygen uptake during unloaded cycling (i.e., at zero external power output but still in an exercise context). This is typically higher than true basal resting metabolic rate due to the metabolic cost of moving the limbs, increased cardiorespiratory work, etc. It can be estimated using the “\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) Calculation” section or set manually.\n\nvLamax (mmol·l⁻¹·s⁻¹):\n\nMaximal rate of lactate production, reflecting the peak capacity of the anaerobic glycolytic pathway (Mader (1984); Mader & Allmer (1996)). It’s a crucial parameter for determining lactate kinetics and substrate utilization.\n\nHRmax (bpm):\n\nMaximal heart rate achievable by the individual.\n\nHRBase (bpm):\n\nBaseline heart rate during unloaded cycling, corresponding to the metabolic state at \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\).\n\nCEHR (bpm·W⁻¹):\n\nHeart Rate Efficiency, also known as the HR-Power slope. It describes the increment in heart rate (beats per minute) for each Watt increase in power output. Typical values in cyclists range from 0.25 to 0.45 bpm·W⁻¹. Lower values are generally indicative of better cardiovascular efficiency.\n\nWeight-based values:\n\nIf checked, the x-axis of the main plot and several displayed output values will be normalized to the individual’s body mass (e.g., power in W·kg⁻¹, \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) in ml·min⁻¹·kg⁻¹). This facilitates comparisons between individuals of different sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) Calculation\nThis utility allows for an estimation of true basal metabolic rate (BMR) using the Harris-Benedict equation, which is then converted to an equivalent resting oxygen uptake. This calculated value can be used to inform the manual setting of the \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) parameter.\n\nGender: (Male/Female) Input for the gender-specific Harris-Benedict formula.\nBody Mass (kg): Input for the Harris-Benedict formula and for general weight-based normalizations.\nAge (years): Input for the Harris-Benedict formula.\nHeight (cm): Input for the Harris-Benedict formula.\nCalculate \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) Button:\n\nTriggers the calculation of BMR (in kcal/day).\nConverts this BMR to a resting \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) value (in ml/min) using standard caloric equivalents for oxygen.\nThe \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) slider in the “Physiological Input-Parameters” section is automatically updated with this calculated value.\nImportant Note: The \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) parameter in Mader’s model typically represents oxygen uptake during unloaded cycling, which is generally higher than the true basal resting \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) calculated here. This tool provides a reference point.\n\n\n\n\nSubstrate Utilization\nThis section controls the visualization and modeling of carbohydrate (CHO) and fat oxidation rates based on the lactate balance calculations derived from Mader’s model (Mader (2003)).\n\nShow Substrate Utilization:\n\nIf checked:\n\nAn additional plot appears below the main P-V̇O₂-La plot, displaying substrate utilization percentages.\nTraces for absolute CHO and Fat oxidation rates (in the units selected via “Energy Unit”) are added to the main plot, typically on a third y-axis.\n\n\nEnergy Unit: (Visible if “Show Substrate Utilization” is checked)\n\nAllows selection of units for displaying absolute substrate oxidation rates:\n\ng/h (grams per hour)\nkcal/h (kilocalories per hour)\nkJ/h (kilojoules per hour)\n\n\nAdjust CHO utilization at rest: (Visible if “Show Substrate Utilization” is checked)\n\nIf checked, this feature allows the user to manually adjust the CHO utilization percentage specifically at rest (0 Watts power output). The model’s default CHO utilization at rest is based purely on its internal calculations (\\(vLa_{SS}/vLa_{ox}\\) ratio). However, empirical data (e.g., Brooks (2012); (Friedman1998?); (Friedman1999?)) often suggest that resting individuals, particularly those who are post-absorptive or well-fed, might have a CHO contribution of around 35-40%. This adjustment helps align the model with such empirical observations if desired.\n\nResting CHO percentage (%): (Visible if “Adjust CHO utilization at rest” is checked)\n\nA slider to set the target CHO utilization percentage at rest. The model will then attempt to shift its calculated CHO utilization curve to pass through (or near) this user-defined resting value.\n\n\nModel Basis for Substrate Utilization: The model assumes that the relative contribution of carbohydrates to total energy expenditure increases with exercise intensity. Specifically, the ratio of lactate production (\\(vLa_{SS}\\)) to lactate oxidation (\\(vLa_{ox}\\)) is used as a proxy for the CHO contribution. As \\(vLa_{SS}\\) approaches \\(vLa_{ox}\\) (i.e., PD approaches zero at MLSS), CHO utilization approaches 100%. Fat oxidation is calculated as the remainder of the aerobic energy demand. Energy equivalents used are approximately 4.1 kcal/g for CHO and 9.45 kcal/g for fat. The predicted Respiratory Quotient (RQ) is derived from this substrate mix (ranging from 0.70 for 100% fat to 1.00 for 100% CHO). This predicted RQ is then used with Stegemann’s table (Stegemann (1991)) to determine the precise caloric equivalent of oxygen (kJ·l⁻¹ or kcal·l⁻¹), which is subsequently used in the efficiency calculations (Δη, ηgross, ηnet).\n\n\nPlot Settings\n\nLock Y-Axis / Lock X-Axis:\n\nWhen checked (default), the respective axis range on the main P-V̇O₂-La plot remains fixed. This is beneficial for comparing the effects of parameter changes, as the plot scale does not change. If unchecked, the axis will auto-scale to encompass all plotted data, which can be useful for initial exploration of wide-ranging parameter values.\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Plot: P-V̇O₂-La Dynamics\nThis central plot visualizes the core steady-state metabolic relationships:\n\nX-Axis: Power output (P), displayed in Watts (W) or Watts per kilogram body mass (W·kg⁻¹) if “Weight-based values” is selected.\nPrimary Y-Axis (Left): Oxygen Uptake (\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\)), displayed in milliliters per minute (ml·min⁻¹) or ml·min⁻¹·kg⁻¹.\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,SS}\\) (Solid Blue Line): Represents the calculated steady-state oxygen uptake at each power output, up to the individual’s \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\).\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,SS,extrapolated}\\) (Dashed Blue Line): Shows the theoretical \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) demand if it were not constrained by \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\). This line continues with the same slope (linear model) or curvature (curvilinear model) beyond \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\).\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) Line (Dotted Grey Line): A horizontal line indicating the individual’s maximal oxygen uptake.\n\nSecondary Y-Axis (Right - yaxis2): Lactate kinetics, with rates in mmol·l⁻¹·min⁻¹ and accumulation in mmol·l⁻¹.\n\nvLaSS (Dashed Red Line): The steady-state rate of lactate production.\nvLaox (Dashed Light Blue Line): The steady-state rate of lactate oxidation (elimination).\nPD (Pyruvate Deficit) (Solid Purple Line): Calculated as \\(vLa_{ox} - vLa_{SS}\\). A positive PD indicates that lactate elimination capacity exceeds production, often associated with higher fat oxidation. A negative PD indicates lactate production exceeds elimination capacity.\n\nFATmax (Vertical Dotted Grey Line): Marks the power output where the Pyruvate Deficit (PD) is maximal. This is often used as an indicator of the intensity eliciting maximal fat oxidation.\nMLSS (Maximal Lactate Steady State) (Vertical Dotted Grey Line): Marks the power output where PD is zero (i.e., \\(vLa_{SS} = vLa_{ox}\\)). This is the theoretical highest intensity at which lactate clearance can keep pace with lactate production, resulting in stable blood lactate levels during prolonged exercise.\n\nLaAccumulation (Solid Dark Red Line): Represents the theoretical blood lactate concentration that would accumulate if exercise at that specific steady-state power output were sustained indefinitely. This is a modeled value, not a direct simulation of blood lactate over time.\n\nTertiary Y-Axis (Right, further out - yaxis3, visible if “Show Substrate Utilization” is checked): Absolute Substrate Utilization rates, in the units selected by the user (g/h, kcal/h, or kJ/h).\n\nCHO (Unit) (Dotted Pink Line): Shows the absolute rate of carbohydrate oxidation.\nFat (Unit) (Dotted Green Line): Shows the absolute rate of fat oxidation.\n\n\nThe plot includes key annotations for FATmax power, MLSS power, \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) value, and the mathematical formula currently defining the \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\)-P relationship (linear or curvilinear, including cadence effects if active).\n\n\nSubstrate Utilization Plot\nThis plot appears below the main plot if “Show Substrate Utilization” is enabled in the control panel.\n\nX-Axis: Power output (P), consistent with the main plot (W or W·kg⁻¹).\nY-Axis: Percentage of Total Aerobic Energy Expenditure (%).\n\nCHO-Utilization (%) (Dotted Pink Line): Shows the relative contribution of carbohydrate oxidation to total aerobic energy production at each power output.\nFat-Utilization (%) (Dotted Dark Green Line): Shows the relative contribution of fat oxidation. This plot provides a clear visual representation of the crossover concept, where the primary fuel source shifts from fats to carbohydrates as exercise intensity increases.\n\n\n\n\nValues Display Area\nLocated below the plot(s), this text area provides a numerical summary of key metabolic parameters calculated at two important physiological points: FATmax and MLSS. For each point, it displays:\n\nPower output (W or W·kg⁻¹)\nSteady-state \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,SS}\\) (absolute and as a percentage of \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\))\nRate of lactate production (\\(vLa_{SS}\\) in mmol·l⁻¹·min⁻¹)\nRate of lactate oxidation (\\(vLa_{ox}\\) in mmol·l⁻¹·min⁻¹)\nPyruvate Deficit (PD in mmol·l⁻¹·min⁻¹)\nTheoretical Lactate Accumulation (LaAccumulation in mmol·l⁻¹)\nIf substrate utilization is shown:\n\nAbsolute carbohydrate oxidation rate (in selected units) and its percentage contribution.\nAbsolute fat oxidation rate (in selected units) and its percentage contribution.\nPredicted Respiratory Quotient (RQ).\n\nCalculated gross efficiency (ηgross in %).\nCalculated net efficiency (ηnet in %).\n\nIf cadence dependency is active, this area will also display the effective \\(CE\\), \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\), and, if their respective dependencies are enabled, the effective \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) and \\(vLa_{max}\\) values for the selected cadence."

    "text": "Tab 2: Exercise Simulation (Dynamic Model)\nThis tab transitions from steady-state assumptions to a dynamic simulation of metabolic responses over time, reacting to changing power outputs defined by an exercise protocol.\nA disclaimer at the top of this tab indicates that its features and calculations are still under development and should be considered experimental.\n\nControl Panel: Exercise Simulation\n\nStep Test / Exercise Simulation Parameters\nThese controls define the exercise protocol to be simulated, or allow for the loading of external power data.\n\nStep Increment (Watts): For a generated incremental step test, this sets the amount by which power increases at each new step.\nStep Duration (s): For a generated step test, this defines the duration (in seconds) of each power step.\nMaximum Power (Watts): The highest power output that will be targeted in a generated incremental step test. The test will ramp up to this power.\nPower Adjustment (%): A global scaling factor (0-200%) applied to all power values in the current workout, whether generated or loaded from a file. This allows for easy simulation of the same relative effort for different fitness levels.\nLoad Example Exercise Data Button: Loads a pre-defined interval workout (including power and cadence data) into the simulation. This is useful for quickly exploring the app’s dynamic capabilities.\nInsert workout file / File Upload:\n\nProvides an interface to upload workout data from external files. Supported formats include .csv (comma-separated values), .txt (tab-separated or other delimited text), .xlsx, and .xls (Microsoft Excel formats).\nThe app expects columns for time (or timestamp), power, and optionally cadence.\nFile has headers: A checkbox (default checked) to indicate whether the first row of the uploaded file contains column names. If unchecked, the app assumes data starts from the first row and uses default column order (Time, Power, Cadence).\nUploaded workout data gap processing: This option determines how the app handles missing data points or time gaps in 1-second interpolated data from an uploaded file:\n\nMaintain last values (Default): If there’s a gap between recorded data points, the power (and cadence, if available) from the last valid preceding data point is carried forward to fill the gap. This is often preferred for visualizing structured interval training where power is meant to be constant during an interval.\nInsert zero values: If there’s a gap, the power (and cadence) for the missing seconds are set to zero. This is useful for analyzing training sessions with distinct rest periods where actual power output drops to zero.\n\n\nSmooth Power Curve (5-point window) Button: Applies a 5-point moving average filter to the current power data (loaded or generated). This can help reduce noise or rapid fluctuations in recorded power data, providing a smoother input for the simulation.\nDisplay Window Settings: These controls allow users to customize the visible range of the plot axes without altering the underlying simulation data or calculations. This is purely for visualization focus.\n\nAdjust X-Axis range (Checkbox): Enables manual adjustment of the time axis.\n\nStart Time (s) / End Time (s) (Sliders): Define the visible start and end times on the x-axis of the simulation plot.\n\nAdjust Y-Axis ranges (Checkbox): Enables manual adjustment of the various y-axes.\n\nPower Y-Axis Maximum (Slider): Sets the maximum value for the primary Y-axis (which displays Power, Cadence, MPA, Strain Score, Glycogen).\n\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) Y-Axis Maximum (Slider): Sets the maximum value for the tertiary Y-axis (displaying \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) and O₂ Deficit).\nLactate Y-Axis Minimum / Maximum (Sliders): Sets the minimum and maximum values for the secondary Y-axis (displaying Lactate, W’, PCr, pH, Rates, RQ, HR).\n\n\n\n\n\nCadence Dependency\nSimilar to Tab 1, this section allows for the incorporation of cadence effects on metabolic parameters during the dynamic simulation.\n\nEnable U-Shaped Cadence Dependency: Activates cadence-dependent adjustments to \\(CE\\), \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\), and optionally \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) and \\(vLa_{max}\\), using the formulas from Dunst et al. (2025).\nFixed Cadence (rpm): (Used if “Use cadence from file” is unchecked or if no cadence data is available in the file). Sets a constant cadence value that will be assumed throughout the simulation if cadence-dependent effects are enabled.\nUse cadence from file (if available):\n\nIf checked AND cadence data is present in an uploaded workout file AND cadence dependency is enabled, the simulation will use the time-varying cadence values from the file to modulate metabolic parameters.\nIf no cadence data is in the file, or if this option is unchecked, the “Fixed Cadence” value will be used if cadence dependency is active.\n\nThe specific dependencies (CE, \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\), Include \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) Dependency, Include vLamax Dependency) can be individually toggled, functioning identically to their Tab 1 counterparts but applied dynamically over time.\n\n\n\nPhysiological Parameters (Dynamic Simulation)\nThese parameters govern the kinetic (time-dependent) responses of the metabolic model.\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) Start (ml·min⁻¹):\n\nThe initial oxygen uptake value at the very beginning (time = 0s) of the simulation. This slider is dynamically constrained to be between the current effective \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) and \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) (which can vary if cadence dependency is active). The default starting value is often set near the \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) at Fatmax from Tab 1.\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,on}\\) time constant (τon) (s):\n\nDefines the speed of the exponential rise of \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) towards its new, higher target value when exercise intensity increases or exercise begins. A smaller τon indicates faster “on” kinetics. The \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) at any time \\(t\\) during an increase is modeled as: $ O_2(t) = O_{2,initial} + (O_{2,target} - O_{2,initial}) (1 - e^{-(t - t_{delay})/_{on}}) $\nIntensity-Dependent τon (Checkbox):\n\nIf checked, τon is not a fixed value. Instead, it’s dynamically calculated for each step based on the \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) (as a percentage of the current \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\)) of the immediately preceding time step. The base formula is \\(\\tau_{on\\_base} = 0.38 \\cdot \\text{PrevIntensity%} + 6\\) seconds. The slider value then acts as the τon that would occur if the preceding intensity was 50% \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\). This means the slider effectively sets an offset to the formula, allowing the user to shift the entire linear τon-intensity relationship. This feature simulates the physiological observation that \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) on-kinetics can be slower if an exercise bout is initiated from a higher pre-existing metabolic rate (e.g., due to prior high-intensity work).\n\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,off}\\) time constant (τoff) (s):\n\nDefines the speed of the exponential fall of \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) towards its new, lower target value when exercise intensity decreases or during recovery.\nIntensity-Dependent τoff (Checkbox):\n\nIf checked, τoff is dynamically calculated based on the maximum \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) (as % of current \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\)) achieved within a lookback window (typically defined as 2 times the previous step’s τoff). The base formula is \\(\\tau_{off\\_base} = 0.45 \\cdot \\text{Intensity%} + 10\\) seconds. Similar to τon, the slider value sets τoff for a reference 50% intensity, thereby shifting the relationship. This models that recovery of \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) might be faster after lower intensity efforts and slower after higher intensity efforts due to factors like greater metabolic disturbance.\n\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) Response Delay (s):\n\nA pure time delay (in seconds) before the exponential \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) response (either “on” or “off”) begins following a change in power output. This accounts for factors like circulatory transit time of blood from lungs to muscles (and vice-versa for CO₂ control feedback) and initial inertia in muscular metabolic pathway activation. Affects the timing of actual \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) change, O₂ deficit/surplus calculation, and subsequently \\(vLa_{ox}\\).\n\nLactate exercise termination value (mmol·l⁻¹):\n\nIf the “Terminate simulation…” checkbox below is active, the simulation will automatically stop if the modeled blood lactate concentration reaches this specified threshold.\n\nTerminate simulation when lactate exceeds max value (Checkbox): Enables or disables the lactate-based abortion criterion.\nResting Lactate-value (mmol·l⁻¹):\n\nThe initial blood lactate concentration assumed at the start (time = 0s) of the simulation.\n\nvLaSS,on Time Constant (τvLaSS,on) (s):\n\nThe time constant governing the exponential rise of the lactate production rate (\\(vLa_{SS}\\)) towards its new, higher target value when exercise intensity increases. Represents how quickly the glycolytic flux adapts upwards.\n\nvLaSS,off Time Constant (τvLaSS,off) (s):\n\nThe time constant governing the exponential fall of \\(vLa_{SS}\\) towards its new, lower target value when exercise intensity decreases or during recovery.\n\nvLaSS Response Delay (s):\n\nA pure time delay (in seconds) before the lactate production rate (\\(vLa_{SS}\\)) begins its exponential kinetic response to a change in exercise intensity. This simulates inherent delays in the activation or deactivation of the glycolytic pathway.\n\nCap vLass by \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) Deficit (Checkbox):\n\nAn optional physiological constraint. If checked, the actual lactate production rate (\\(vLa_{SS}\\)) at any given time point is capped. The cap is determined such that the net anaerobic energy supply (derived from lactate production minus concurrent lactate oxidation) does not exceed the current calculated oxygen deficit (which is \\(\\dot{V}O_2 \\text{ Demand} - \\dot{V}O_2 \\text{ Actual}\\)). The purpose is to enhance physiological plausibility by preventing an unrealistic “overshoot” of anaerobic energy production, especially when aerobic energy supply is still increasing or limited. Default is off, meaning \\(vLa_{SS}\\) is determined purely by its own kinetics without this energy balance cap.\n\nMuscle pH (pHm) Simulation:\n\nThis feature simulates changes in intramuscular pH (pHm). The calculation is based on principles outlined by Mader (2003) and further discussed in texts like Heck & Bartmus (2022, Ch. 4, not in provided citation list). It considers:\n\nEstimated inorganic phosphate concentration [Pi], which is inversely related to [PCr].\nIntramuscular lactate concentration [La]m, derived from the dynamic lactate accumulation model.\nEstimated arterial partial pressure of CO₂ (pCO₂), which is modeled to increase with relative exercise intensity (%\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\)).\n\nThe pHm calculated from the previous time step is then used to modulate the effective maximal lactate production rate (\\(vLa_{max,eff}\\)) for the current time step. This simulates the well-known inhibitory effect of falling pH on key glycolytic enzymes, particularly phosphofructokinase (PFK). The relationship is often sigmoidal: \\(vLa_{max,eff} = vLa_{max,base} \\cdot \\text{PFK_Activity_Factor(pH}_m\\text{)}\\) where PFK_Activity_Factor decreases as pHm drops below a certain threshold (e.g., below ~7.0).\nThis pH-modulated \\(vLa_{max,eff}\\) then becomes the input for determining the target \\(vLa_{SS}\\) for the current time step, creating a feedback loop where high lactate production can lead to lower pH, which in turn can reduce further lactate production.\n\n\n\n\nGlycogen Storage Parameters\nThis section models the dynamics of muscle glycogen stores during exercise, including depletion due to carbohydrate oxidation and potential repletion from carbohydrate intake.\n\nAuto-calculate glycogen values based on muscle mass (Checkbox):\n\nIf checked, the “Initial Glycogen Storage” and “Maximum Glycogen Storage” sliders are automatically populated based on the “Active Muscle Mass” value (from the PCr section). This calculation assumes typical glycogen concentrations in muscle tissue, for example, around 15 g of glycogen per kg of active muscle for normal, fed states, and perhaps 20 g/kg for carbohydrate-loaded states.\n\nInitial Glycogen Storage (g):\n\nThe amount of glycogen (in grams) assumed to be available in the active muscle mass at the beginning of the simulation.\n\nMaximum Glycogen Storage (g):\n\nThe physiological upper limit for glycogen storage in the active muscle mass. Repletion from carbohydrate intake will not exceed this value.\n\nCarbohydrate Intake Rate (g·h⁻¹):\n\nThe rate (in grams per hour) at which exogenous carbohydrates are ingested and become available for either direct oxidation or glycogen synthesis during the simulation. Typical maximal exogenous CHO oxidation rates are often cited around 60-90 g/h, depending on the type of CHO and individual training status ((Jeukendrup2005?); Jeukendrup & Gleeson (2019)).\n\n\nThe model calculates glycogen depletion based on the rate of carbohydrate oxidation. The CHO oxidation rate itself is derived dynamically from the balance of \\(vLa_{SS}\\) and \\(vLa_{ox}\\), similar to Tab 1, but applied kinetically over time. If glycogen stores reach zero, it can trigger a simulation abortion if that condition is set.\n\n\nW’ Balance Parameters\nThis section implements a model for W’ (pronounced “W prime”), which represents the finite amount of work that can be performed above an individual’s Critical Power (CP). Depletion of W’ is associated with fatigue.\n\nCritical Power (CP) (W):\n\nThe highest power output that can, theoretically, be sustained for a very long time without a progressive loss of homeostasis or depletion of W’. It’s a key parameter in endurance performance modeling.\n\nW’ (kJ):\n\nThe total amount of work (expressed in kilojoules) that can be performed above CP before W’ is fully depleted. It reflects anaerobic capacity and tolerance for high-intensity exercise.\n\nPmax (W):\n\nMaximum instantaneous power an athlete can produce, typically in a very short sprint (e.g., a few seconds). This parameter is integral to the 3-parameter critical power model and is specifically used in this app for calculating MPA (Maximum Power Available) and the Strain Score (SS), drawing on concepts from Hauser et al. (2014) and potentially more recent work like Kontro et al. (2025, though not in the provided citation list, the HTML formulas align with this). Pmax is considered to represent the capacity of the alactic (PCr/immediate) energy system.\n\nUse MLSS from Tab 1 as CP (Checkbox):\n\nIf checked (default), the CP value for this simulation is automatically set to the MLSS power output calculated in Tab 1. The CP slider below becomes disabled. This provides a physiologically grounded estimate for CP.\n\nW’ Balance Minimum (kJ):\n\nA user-defined lower threshold for W’ balance.\n\nAbort simulation when W’ Balance falls below slider minimum (Checkbox):\n\nIf checked (default), the simulation will terminate if the calculated W’BAL (W’ balance) drops below the specified “W’ Balance Minimum”.\n\n\nThe W’ balance dynamics are modeled as follows (conceptually similar to the model by Skiba and colleagues, though specific citation from list is pending): * During exercise above CP (P &gt; CP), W’ depletes: $ W’{BAL}(t) = W’{BAL}(u) - (P - CP) (t-u) $ where \\(W'_{BAL}(t)\\) is W’ balance at time \\(t\\), \\(W'_{BAL}(u)\\) is W’ balance at previous time \\(u\\), and \\((t-u)\\) is the time interval. * During exercise below CP (P &lt; CP), W’ recovers: The recovery follows an exponential pattern, often described by: $ W’_{BAL}(t) = W’0 - (W’0 - W’{BAL}(u)) e^{-((CP - P{recovery})/W’_0) (t-u)} $ where \\(W'_0\\) is the initial W’ capacity, and \\(P_{recovery}\\) is the power output during recovery.\nThe MPA & Strain Score (SS) model, drawing from work like Hauser et al. (2014) and Kontro et al. (2025, formulas in HTML), is calculated as: * MPA (Maximum Power Available): The highest power output theoretically achievable at any given moment, considering the current W’ depletion. $ MPA = P_{max} - (P_{max} - CP) (W’{EXP}/W’)^2 $ where \\(W'_{EXP}\\) is the amount of W’ expended (\\(W'_0 - W'_{BAL}\\)). * kstrain (Strain Coefficient): A factor that modulates the perceived strain based on current power relative to MPA and CP. $ k{strain} = (P_{max} - MPA + CP)/(P_{max} - P + CP) $ * SR (Strain Rate): The instantaneous rate of strain accumulation. $ SR = k_{strain} P $ * SS (Strain Score): The cumulative strain over the exercise bout. $ SS = (SR t) () $ The Normalization Factor, \\((P_{max}/CP^2) \\cdot (100/3600)\\), scales the score so that 1 hour at CP roughly equals 100 SS points.\n\n\nPCr and O₂ Deficit Model\nThis section simulates the dynamics of phosphocreatine (PCr) stores in the active muscle and the associated oxygen deficit incurred at the onset of exercise or during increases in intensity.\n\nResting PCr (mmol·kg⁻¹ wet muscle weight):\n\nThe initial concentration of PCr in the active muscle tissue at the start of the simulation. Typical physiological values in humans range from about 15 to 38 mmol·kg⁻¹ ww. PCr serves as an immediate buffer for ATP regeneration.\n\nP/O₂ (mol ATP · mol O₂⁻¹):\n\nThe P/O₂ ratio represents the stoichiometry of oxidative phosphorylation: the number of moles of ATP synthesized per mole of diatomic oxygen (O₂) reduced. This value is not constant but depends on the substrate being oxidized and the efficiency of the electron transport chain. It’s typically around 4.61 for pure fat oxidation and up to 5.0 for pure carbohydrate oxidation. The slider allows for adjustment within this physiological range.\n\nActive Muscle Mass (kg):\n\nThe estimated mass of the muscle actively involved in the cycling exercise. This is a crucial parameter as PCr concentrations are expressed per kg of muscle. The tooltip provides research-based estimates (e.g., for cyclists, women: ~22-25.5% of body weight; men: ~27-31.5% of body weight, depending on seated/standing, drawing from data like Janssen et al. (2000) (not in list) and general exercise physiology).\n\nO₂-Lactate Equiv. (β) (Display Only):\n\nDisplayed as a constant value of approximately 3.0 ml O₂·kg⁻¹·mM⁻¹. This represents the “oxygen equivalent of lactate accumulation,” meaning the amount of O₂ (in ml per kg body mass) that would have been required aerobically to produce the energy equivalent to accumulating 1 mM of lactate in the blood. This concept, detailed by (diPrampero1981?) (not in provided citation list, but noted in HTML comments), is used in the model to help partition the O₂ deficit between contributions from PCr breakdown and net lactate production.\n\nShow \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) Demand Curve (Checkbox):\n\nIf checked, the simulation plot will include a trace representing the theoretical, instantaneous \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) demand required to meet the energy cost of the current power output. The area between this demand curve and the actual kinetically-limited \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) curve visually represents the accumulated oxygen deficit (or surplus during recovery).\n\n\nPCr Model Dynamics: The model calculates changes in the PCr store based on the balance between O₂ demand and actual O₂ uptake: * PCr Depletion: When \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) demand exceeds actual \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) uptake (O₂ deficit), a portion of this deficit is met by the breakdown of PCr to resynthesize ATP. The amount of PCr consumed is proportional to this O₂ deficit portion, scaled by the P/O₂ ratio. $ PCr_{consumed} () (P/O_2 ) $ * PCr Resynthesis: When actual \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) uptake exceeds \\(\\dot{V}O_2\\) demand (O₂ surplus, e.g., during recovery or lower intensity), PCr is resynthesized. This process also consumes ATP (and thus O₂) and is proportional to the O₂ surplus, scaled by the P/O₂ ratio and a resynthesis efficiency factor (set to 0.5 in the code, meaning 50% of O2 surplus contributes to PCr resynthesis). $ PCr_{resynthesized} ( ) (P/O_2 ) $ The accumulated O₂ deficit represents the total volume of oxygen that would have been consumed if aerobic metabolism could have instantaneously met the energy demand from the start of exercise.\n\n\nModel Parameters (for Tab 2 Simulation)\nThis section allows the user to choose whether the physiological parameters for the Tab 2 simulation are taken from Tab 1 or set independently.\n\nUse model parameters from Tab 1 (Checkbox):\n\nChecked (Default): The core physiological parameters for the simulation (CE, \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\), \\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\), vLamax, Body Mass, HR parameters, and curvilinear settings) are directly mirrored from their current values in Tab 1. The individual parameter sliders below this checkbox become disabled but will reflect the values from Tab 1. This ensures consistency if the user wants to simulate dynamics based on a profile established in the steady-state tab. Changes in Tab 1 will automatically propagate to these linked parameters.\nUnchecked: The individual parameter sliders below this checkbox become active, allowing the user to define a completely independent set of physiological parameters for the Tab 2 simulation, different from those in Tab 1.\n\nIndividual Parameter Sliders: (Active if “Use model parameters from Tab 1” is unchecked)\n\nCurvilinear CE relationship (Checkbox): As in Tab 1.\nCE (ml·min⁻¹·W⁻¹) (Slider): For linear CE model.\nCEStart / CETarget (Sliders): For curvilinear CE model.\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,max}\\) (ml·min⁻¹) (Slider)\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2,Base}\\) (ml·min⁻¹) (Slider)\nvLamax (mmol·l⁻¹·s⁻¹) (Slider)\nBody Mass (kg) (Slider)\nHRmax (bpm) (Slider)\nHRBase (bpm) (Slider)\nCEHR (bpm·W⁻¹) (Slider)\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise Simulation Plot (Tab 2)\nThis is a dynamic, multi-trace plot that visualizes various simulated physiological and performance parameters over the time course of the defined exercise protocol.\n\nX-Axis: Time (seconds).

This is useful for focusing on specific parameters. If the simulation is terminated prematurely due to one of the set abort conditions (lactate, W’ balance, glycogen depletion, or PCr depletion), an annotation will appear on the plot marking the point and reason for termination.\n\n\nExercise Summary Statistics (Tab 2)\nLocated below the simulation plot, this section provides a quantitative summary of the entire simulated exercise session.\n\nAverage mechanical Power (W): Time-weighted average of the power output.\nNormalized mechanical Power (W): A power averaging method that gives more weight to higher intensity portions, often used for estimating physiological strain (conceptually similar to TrainingPeaks® NP®).
