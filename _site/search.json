The ability to account for cadence effects enhances the precision of these prescriptions, especially for cyclists who may use different cadences during training and competition.\nAs highlighted by Dunst et al. (2025), neglecting movement velocity in metabolic modeling can lead to significant errors in performance predictions, with deviations of up to 100W in threshold power estimates. By incorporating cadence-dependent relationships, the application provides a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between movement velocity and metabolic processes, enhancing the utility of Mader’s model for endurance performance prediction and training optimization.",

    "text": "Pyruvate Deficit (PD)\nThe pyruvate deficit represents the difference between the capacity to metabolize pyruvate via oxidative phosphorylation and the pyruvate produced by glycolysis:\n\\[\nPD = vLa_{ox} - vLa_{ss}\n\\tag{11}\\]\nA positive PD indicates that the oxidative system can process more pyruvate than is being produced, allowing for fat oxidation. A negative PD indicates lactate accumulation as glycolysis exceeds oxidative capacity.\nThe maximum pyruvate deficit (PD\\(_{max}\\)) corresponds to the intensity with the highest fat oxidation rate, often referred to as FAT\\(_{max}\\):\n\\[\n\\text{FAT}_{max} = \\max(PD)\n\\tag{12}\\]\nThe maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) occurs where PD equals zero, indicating a balance between lactate production and elimination:\n\\[\n\\text{MLSS} = \\{P | PD(P) = 0\\}\n\\tag{13}\\]\nIn the Shiny application, these thresholds are identified by finding the power values corresponding to the maximum of the PD curve and the point where PD crosses zero, respectively."

    "text": "Impact of Movement Velocity on Metabolic Parameters\nDunst et al. (2025) demonstrated that incorporating cadence-dependent relationships for \\(CE_{V\\dot{O}_2}\\) and \\(\\dot{V}O_{2Base}\\) into Mader’s model significantly affects predicted power outputs at metabolic thresholds. Their findings revealed polynomial relationships between cadence and threshold-specific power outputs, with optimal cadences of 84 rpm for MAP, 80 rpm for MLSS, and 70 rpm for FAT\\(_{max}\\) when using cadence-dependent \\(CE_{V\\dot{O}_2}\\) and \\(\\dot{V}O_{2Base}\\) with constant \\(vLa_{max}\\).\nThe mathematical functions describing these cadence dependencies were:\n\\[\nCE_{V\\dot{O}_2}(PR) = 0.0004 \\cdot PR^2 - 0.094 \\cdot PR + 16.857\n\\tag{15}\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{V}O_{2Base}(PR) = 0.172 \\cdot PR^2 - 14.460 \\cdot PR + 548.039\n\\tag{16}\\]\nWhere \\(PR\\) is the pedaling rate in rpm.\nWhen these relationships are incorporated into the model, the power output at a given metabolic threshold becomes a function of cadence:\n\\[\nP(PR) = \\frac{\\dot{V}O_{2ss}(PR) - \\dot{V}O_{2Base}(PR)}{CE_{V\\dot{O}_2}(PR)}\n\\tag{17}\\]\nThis approach represents a significant advancement in metabolic modeling, as it acknowledges that metabolic responses are not fixed but vary with movement velocity, offering more precise predictions for endurance performance."

    "text": "Practical Application\nThe Shiny application visualizes these relationships, allowing users to explore how changes in physiological parameters and cadence affect metabolic thresholds. The app displays power output-specific values for \\(\\dot{V}O_{2ss}\\), \\(vLa_{ss}\\), \\(vLa_{ox}\\), PD, and lactate accumulation, providing insights into the metabolic profile at different intensities.\nFor training prescription, the identification of FATmax and MLSS is particularly valuable, as these thresholds demarcate important training zones. The ability to account for cadence effects enhances the precision of these prescriptions, especially for cyclists who may use different cadences during training and competition.\nAs highlighted by Dunst et al. (2025), neglecting movement velocity in metabolic modeling can lead to significant errors in performance predictions, with deviations of up to 100W in threshold power estimates. By incorporating cadence-dependent relationships, the application provides a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between movement velocity and metabolic processes, enhancing the utility of Mader’s model for endurance performance prediction and training optimization."
