The original formulation by Mader and Heck (1986) expressed glycolytic activity as a function of ADP concentration:\n\\[\nvLa_{ss} = \\frac{vLa_{max}}{1 + \\frac{ks_2}{[ADP]^3}}\n\\tag{9}\\]\nWhere [ADP] represents the concentration of adenosine diphosphate, which reflects the energy state of the muscle cell. However, measuring [ADP] directly is impractical in applied settings. The ingenious solution was to express [ADP] in terms of measurable parameters related to oxygen uptake.\nThe relationship between oxidative phosphorylation and [ADP] follows a similar Michaelis-Menten pattern:\n\\[\n\\dot{V}O_{2ss} = \\frac{\\dot{V}O_{2max}}{1 + \\frac{ks_1}{[ADP]^2}}\n\\tag{10}\\]\nThrough algebraic manipulation, this equation can be rearranged to express [ADP] in terms of oxygen uptake:\n\\[\n[ADP]^2 = \\frac{ks_1 \\cdot \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}{\\dot{V}O_{2max} - \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}\n\\tag{11}\\]\nTherefore:\n\\[\n[ADP] = \\left(\\frac{ks_1 \\cdot \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}{\\dot{V}O_{2max} - \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}\\right)^{1/2}\n\\tag{12}\\]\nSubstituting this expression into the original equation for \\(vLa_{ss}\\) and raising both sides to appropriate powers:\n\\[\n[ADP]^3 = \\left(\\frac{ks_1 \\cdot \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}{\\dot{V}O_{2max} - \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}\\right)^{3/2}\n\\tag{13}\\]\nThis leads to the final formulation:\n\\[\nvLa_{ss} = \\frac{vLa_{max}}{1 + ks_2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\dot{V}O_{2max} - \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}{ks_1 \\cdot \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}\\right)^{3/2}}\n\\tag{14}\\]\nThis equation elegantly connects glycolytic activity to oxygen uptake parameters, enabling practical application of the model using standard physiological measurements. The exponent 3/2 arises directly from the combination of the squared relationship between oxygen uptake and [ADP] (exponent 1/2) and the cubed relationship between glycolysis and [ADP] (exponent 3).\nInterestingly, in some literature, particularly in running applications Ji et al. (2021), the equation appears with an exponent of 3 rather than 3/2 due to a different algebraic arrangement of the terms. However, both formulations are mathematically equivalent and describe the same physiological relationship.\nThe term \\(\\left(\\frac{\\dot{V}O_{2max} - \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}{ks_1 \\cdot \\dot{V}O_{2ss}}\\right)^{3/2}\\) represents the phosphorylation state of the muscle cell, which regulates glycolytic flux.

FATmax: The power output with maximum fat oxidation potential 2. MLSS: The highest sustainable power without progressive lactate accumulation 3. BLC ≈ 4.0: The power output corresponding to a blood lactate of approximately 4 mmol/l\nFor each of these points, the text output area shows: - The exact power output (in watts or W/kg) - The corresponding VO2 value (in ml/min or ml/kg/min) - The lactate production rate (vLass) - The lactate elimination rate (vLaox) - The pyruvate deficit (PD) - The accumulated blood lactate\nThese detailed quantitative outputs enable precise training prescription and performance prediction based on individual physiological profiles.\nFor training prescription, the identification of FATmax and MLSS is particularly valuable, as these thresholds demarcate important training zones. The ability to account for cadence effects enhances the precision of these prescriptions, especially for cyclists who may use different cadences during training and competition.\nAs highlighted by Dunst et al. (2025), neglecting movement velocity in metabolic modeling can lead to significant errors in performance predictions, with deviations of up to 100W in threshold power estimates. By incorporating cadence-dependent relationships, the application provides a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between movement velocity and metabolic processes, enhancing the utility of Mader’s model for endurance performance prediction and training optimization.\nRecent critical analysis by Nolte et al.

Their findings suggest that while the model provides valuable qualitative insights into metabolic processes, individual variations in lactate removal capabilities and potential limitations in vLamax measurement protocols may affect the accuracy of threshold predictions. Users should therefore interpret the model outputs as one component of a comprehensive assessment rather than as definitive values.\nNevertheless, the model’s ability to simulate how different combinations of aerobic and anaerobic capacities can produce similar performance outcomes offers unique insights for training prescription. As Ji et al. (2021) demonstrated, the model can help identify specific physiological limitations (aerobic capacity, glycolytic capacity, or movement economy) that may be limiting an athlete’s performance, allowing for more targeted training interventions."

This simulation extends the steady-state calculations to account for the temporal dynamics of physiological adaptation during exercise.\n\nTime-Dependent VO₂ Kinetics\nWhile the first tab focuses on steady-state relationships, the exercise simulation incorporates time constants to model the delay in oxygen uptake response to changes in exercise intensity:\n\\[\n\\dot{V}O_2(t) = \\dot{V}O_2(t-1) + (\\dot{V}O_{2ss} - \\dot{V}O_2(t-1)) \\cdot (1 - e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau})\n\\tag{25}\\]\n\n\\(\\dot{V}O_2(t)\\) is the actual oxygen uptake at time \\(t\\)\n\\(\\dot{V}O_{2ss}\\) is the steady-state oxygen uptake for the current power output\n\\(\\Delta t\\) is the time step (typically 1 second in the simulation)\n\\(\\tau\\) is the time constant, which can differ for increases (\\(\\tau_{up}\\)) and decreases (\\(\\tau_{down}\\)) in intensity\n\nThis mono-exponential model accounts for the delayed response of oxidative metabolism to changes in power output, which significantly affects metabolic responses during interval training or variable-intensity exercise.\nIn the application, users can adjust both the upward and downward time constants through slider controls. This allows for exploration of how different VO2 kinetics profiles affect metabolic responses. The simulation applies these time constants to calculate the actual VO2 value for each second of the exercise bout, starting from the resting VO2 value.\n\n\nDynamic Lactate Modeling\nThe simulation calculates instantaneous rates of lactate production and elimination based on the actual (not steady-state) oxygen uptake at each time point:\n\nLactate production (\\(vLa_{ss}\\)) is calculated using the equation #eq-vLass but with the actual \\(\\dot{V}O_2(t)\\) rather than \\(\\dot{V}O_{2ss}\\). This is a critical distinction, as it accounts for the delayed VO2 response during transitions in exercise intensity.\nLactate elimination incorporates concentration-dependent kinetics:\n\n\\[\nvLa_{ox}(t) = \\frac{CE_{La\\dot{O}_2} \\cdot \\dot{V}O_2(t)}{VolLa \\cdot 60} \\cdot \\min(La(t-1), 15) / 8\n\\tag{26}\\]\nWhere \\(La(t-1)\\) is the blood lactate concentration from the previous time step. The factor \\(\\min(La(t-1), 15) / 8\\) represents the saturation of lactate transporters at higher concentrations, with maximal transport occurring around 8 mmol·l⁻¹ and diminishing returns beyond 15 mmol·l⁻¹.\nThis concentration-dependent modification is an important advancement beyond the steady-state model, as it more realistically represents how lactate clearance increases with elevated blood lactate levels. The application applies this enhanced equation for each time point in the simulation.\n\nThe change in blood lactate concentration is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta La(t) = (vLa_{ss}(t) - vLa_{ox}(t)) \\cdot \\Delta t\n\\tag{27}\\]\nThis equation is applied for each time step to determine how much lactate is added to or removed from the blood.\n\nBlood lactate concentration is updated while ensuring it doesn’t fall below baseline:\n\n\\[\nLa(t) = \\max(La_{base}, La(t-1) + \\Delta La(t))\n\\tag{28}\\]\nThe baseline lactate value is user-adjustable through the “Ruhelaktat” slider, allowing simulation of different resting conditions. The application ensures that calculated lactate never falls below this baseline, reflecting the physiological reality that basal metabolism maintains a minimum lactate level."

The model uniquely incorporates both maximal aerobic capacity (\\(\\dot{V}O_{2max}\\)) and maximal glycolytic rate (\\(vLa_{max}\\)) to simulate the dynamic interplay between oxidative and glycolytic energy systems during exercise.\nThe fundamental strength of Mader’s approach lies in its physiological basis, describing metabolic processes through Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics that reflect the activation of energy systems as functions of the cytosolic phosphorylation state. This allows for a mechanistically sound prediction of key performance indicators like Maximal Lactate Steady State (MLSS) and peak fat oxidation (FAT\\(_{max}\\)), offering insights that go beyond empirical threshold concepts.\nIn recent years, researchers have extended the application of this model from cycling to running, validating its transferability across exercise modalities. While the core mathematical principles remain consistent across applications, several sport-specific adaptations have been implemented to account for the fundamental differences between these activities."

    "text": "Sport-Specific Adaptations: Cycling vs. Running\nWhile Mader’s model maintains its fundamental structure across different exercise modalities, several important adaptations are necessary when transferring between cycling and running applications:\n\nIntensity Measurement: In cycling, power output (Watts) serves as the primary intensity metric, offering a direct measure of mechanical work. In contrast, running utilizes velocity (m·s\\(^{-1}\\)) as the intensity parameter, which introduces additional complexities related to terrain, body mass, and running economy.\nOxygen Demand Relationship: For cycling, oxygen demand is typically expressed relative to power output using the constant \\(CE_{V\\dot{O}_2}\\) (ml·min\\(^{-1}\\)·W\\(^{-1}\\)). In running models, this relationship is captured by the parameter Ks4, representing oxygen demand per unit of running velocity (ml·kg\\(^{-1}\\)·min\\(^{-1}\\) per m·s\\(^{-1}\\)).\nEconomy Considerations: Running economy demonstrates greater inter-individual variation than cycling economy due to its weight-bearing nature and the influence of biomechanical factors. Consequently, running models require individual determination of Ks4 through empirical testing, whereas cycling models traditionally used a standardized \\(CE_{V\\dot{O}_2}\\) value across subjects.\nMass-Specific Values: Running calculations typically employ mass-specific values (ml·kg\\(^{-1}\\)·min\\(^{-1}\\)) for oxygen uptake, while cycling calculations often use absolute values (ml·min\\(^{-1}\\)), though weight-normalized values (W·kg\\(^{-1}\\)) are increasingly common for power measurements in cycling.\nModel Validation: The validity of Mader’s model appears to vary between cycling and running. Nolte et al. (2022) found that for both modalities, experimental data showed significant deviations from model predictions, with running data requiring a significantly higher lactate removal constant (\\(k_{re}\\) of 0.1347 vs. 0.0533 mmol·kg·l⁻¹·ml⁻¹ for cycling) to achieve reasonable fit. These findings suggest that fundamental differences in muscle recruitment patterns, blood flow dynamics, and lactate kinetics between running and cycling may not be fully captured by the current model.\nMeasurement Protocols: The procedures for determining vLamax differ between cycling (typically short isokinetic sprints) and running (fixed-distance sprints), potentially introducing methodological biases. Ji et al. (2021) highlighted the need for developing running-specific vLamax assessment protocols to improve the accuracy of the model in running applications.\n\nRecent research by Dunst et al. (2025) has further highlighted the importance of considering movement velocity (cadence in cycling) when applying these models, demonstrating that neglecting this factor can lead to significant errors in threshold power estimates."

This formulation places the exponents on the entire fraction rather than just the numerator of the ADP-dependent term, which Nolte argues is more mathematically appropriate as it ensures the argument of the power function remains dimensionless.\nThrough algebraic manipulation, Nolte derives a relationship between normalized net lactate accumulation and normalized oxygen uptake:\n\\[\n\\%\\dot{c}La_{net}= \\left(1+\\left(\\frac{K_{La}}{K_{ox}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1-\\%\\dot{V}O_2}{\\%\\dot{V}O_2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n_{ox}}}\\right)^{n_{La}}\\right)^{-1} - \\left(\\frac{\\dot{V}O_{2,max}}{\\dot{c}La_{max}}\\right) \\cdot k_{re} \\cdot \\%\\dot{V}O_2\n\\tag{31}\\]\nThis equation reveals that \\(\\%\\dot{c}La_{net}\\) is determined by the difference between a nonlinear term (glycolytic activity) and a linear term (lactate removal).

When the simulated blood lactate reaches this threshold, the application identifies the time point and corresponding power output, then truncates all data series at this point. This termination point is marked in the visualization with a vertical line and labeled with the corresponding power output.\n\n\nHandling Variable Power Profiles\nThe application supports three methods for defining power profiles:\n\nStep test simulation: Automatically generates a ramp protocol with user-defined step duration and power increments. Users can adjust the step size in watts, the duration of each step in seconds, and the maximum power to reach.\nInterval example: Pre-defined interval workout with alternating moderate and high-intensity periods, loaded by clicking the “Beispiel Intervalldaten laden” button. This provides a standardized profile for exploring interval training responses.\nCustom data upload: Allows users to import their own power-time data from CSV files through the file upload control. The application supports different CSV formats with options for headers and separators.\n\nFor each approach, the application interpolates between data points to ensure a continuous power profile at 1-second resolution. When the “smooth power” option is enabled, a 10-second moving average filter is applied to reduce noise:\n\\[\nP_{smooth}(t) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{i=t-4}^{t+5} P(i)\n\\tag{33}\\]\nThis smoothing can help reduce the impact of measurement noise in uploaded power data, providing more stable metabolic predictions.\n\n\nPractical Implementation and Visualization\nThe exercise simulation visualizes the dynamic interplay between power output, oxygen uptake, lactate production/elimination rates, and blood lactate concentration throughout the exercise bout. This provides valuable insights into how metabolic stress evolves over time and how the timing of intensity changes affects physiological responses.\nThe visualization includes: - Power output on the primary Y-axis (left side) - Blood lactate concentration on a secondary Y-axis (right side) - Lactate production and elimination rates on the same axis as lactate - VO2 on a third Y-axis (far right) - Time on the X-axis - Markers for the lactate threshold and termination point\nThe application uses a multi-axis plotting system to display all these variables simultaneously, allowing users to observe the relationships between mechanical work, metabolic demand, and physiological responses in real time.\nThe simulation is particularly useful for:\n\nPredicting time-to-exhaustion at different constant power outputs\nOptimizing interval training protocols by visualizing the metabolic consequences of work-recovery ratios\nUnderstanding the impact of VO₂ kinetics on metabolic responses during variable-intensity exercise\nExploring how different physiological profiles (varying VO₂max, vLamax, etc.) respond to the same exercise protocol\n\nBy integrating both steady-state metabolic relationships and time-dependent kinetics, the application provides a comprehensive tool for understanding and predicting metabolic responses to exercise across a wide range of scenarios relevant to both research and applied sport science contexts."
