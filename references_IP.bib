abstract = {Measures of substrate oxidation have traditionally been calculated from indirect calorimetry measurements using stoichiometric equations. Although this has proven to be a solid technique and it has become one of the standard techniques to measure whole body substrate metabolism, there are also several limitations that have to be considered. When indirect calorimetry is used during exercise most of the assumptions on which the method is based hold true although changes in the size of the bicarbonate pool at higher exercise intensities may invalidate the calculations of carbohydrate and fat oxidation. Most of the existing equations are based on stoichiometric equations of glucose oxidation and the oxidation of a triacylglycerol that is representative of human adipose tissue. However, in many exercise conditions, glycogen and not glucose is the predominant carbohydrate substrate. Therefore we propose slightly modified equations for the calculation of carbohydrate and fat oxidation for use during low to high intensity exercise. Studies that investigated fat oxidation over a wide range of intensities and that determined the exercise intensity at which fat oxidation is maximal have provided useful insights in the variation in fat oxidation between individuals and in the factors that affect fat oxidation. Fat oxidation during exercise can be influenced by exercise intensity and duration, diet, exercise training, exercise mode and gender. Although a number of important factors regulating fat oxidation have been identified, it is apparent that a considerable degree of inter-subject variability in substrate utilization persists and cannot be explained by the aforementioned factors. Future research should investigate the causes of the large inter-individual differences in fat metabolism between individuals and their links with various disease states.},

abstract = {Post-exercise recovery strategies influence the body's ability to restore physiological homeostasis, replenish energy stores, repair muscle damage, and promote desired adaptations, which improve exercise performance. This narrative review examines the impact of nutritional strategies commonly used for enhancing recovery and subsequent exercise performance, particularly when athletes face short recovery periods. Carbohydrate ingestion is essential for glycogen replenishment, especially within the initial hours post-exercise, with its impact dependent on the types, timing, and amount. Protein is essential for accelerating muscle recovery and achieving a positive nitrogen balance, depending on the type and dosage. The co-ingestion of carbohydrates with proteins or fats is explored for its role in maximizing glycogen resynthesis and muscle repair, with evidence supporting the addition of protein to suboptimal carbohydrate intake for enhanced recovery. Moreover, this review addresses the potential benefits of creatine and caffeine co-ingestion for accelerating glycogen synthesis and improving subsequent performance. Hydration strategies, including the use of milk-based beverages and electrolyte solutions, are also discussed, emphasizing their importance in maintaining fluid balance and optimizing recovery. This review also highlights the emerging role of micronutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and sodium bicarbonate in reducing muscle damage and improving acid–base balance. Evidence supports the tailored use of these nutritional strategies, particularly for athletes managing tight competition/training schedules. Future research should focus on refining individualized approaches for recovery and investigating the impact of novel supplements on subsequent performance.},

abstract = {The ability of athletes to train day after day depends in large part on adequate restoration of muscle glycogen stores, a process that requires the consumption of sufficient dietary carbohydrates and ample time. Providing effective guidance to athletes and others wishing to enhance training adaptations and improve performance requires an understanding of the normal variations in muscle glycogen content in response to training and diet; the time required for adequate restoration of glycogen stores; the influence of the amount, type, and timing of carbohydrate intake on glycogen resynthesis; and the impact of other nutrients on glycogenesis. This review highlights the practical implications of the latest research related to glycogen metabolism in physically active individuals to help sports dietitians, coaches, personal trainers, and other sports health professionals gain a fundamental understanding of glycogen metabolism, as well as related practical applications for enhancing training adaptations and preparing for competition.},

abstract = {There is little evidence that body size alters exogenous glucose oxidation rates during exercise. This study assessed whether larger people oxidize more exogenous glucose during exercise than smaller people. Fifteen cyclists were allocated into two groups based on body mass (SMALL, <70 kg body mass, n = 9, two females) or (LARGE, >70 kg body mass, n = 6) matched for lactate threshold (SMALL: 2.3 ± 0.4 W/kg, LARGE: 2.3 ± 0.3 W/kg). SMALL completed 120 min of cycling at 95% of lactate threshold1. LARGE completed two trials in a random order, one at 95% of lactate threshold1 (thereby exercising at the same relative intensity [RELATIVE]) and one at an absolute intensity matched to SMALL (ABSOLUTE). In all trials, cyclists ingested 90 g/hr of 13C-enriched glucose. Total exogenous glucose oxidation was (mean ± SD) 33 ± 8 g/hr in SMALL versus 45 ± 13 g/hr in LARGE-RELATIVE (mean difference: 13 g/hr, 95% confidence interval [2, 24] g/hr, p = .03). Large positive correlations were observed for measures of exogenous carbohydrate oxidation versus body size (body mass, height, and body surface area; e.g., body surface area vs. peak exogenous glucose oxidation, r = .85, 95% confidence interval [.51, .95], p < .01). When larger athletes reduced the intensity from RELATIVE to ABSOLUTE, total exogenous glucose oxidation was 39 ± 7 g/hr (p = .43 vs. LARGE-RELATIVE). In conclusion, the capacity for exogenous glucose oxidation is, on average, higher in larger athletes than smaller athletes during exercise. The extent to which this is due to higher absolute exercise intensity requires further research, but body size may be a consideration in tailoring sports nutrition guidelines for carbohydrate intake during exercise.},

abstract = {Background: Sports nutrition guidelines recommend carbohydrate (CHO) intake be individualized to the athlete and modulated according to changes in training load. However, there are limited methods to assess CHO utilization during training sessions. Objectives: We aimed to (1) quantify bivariate relationships between both CHO and overall energy expenditure (EE) during exercise and commonly used, non-invasive measures of training load across sessions of varying duration and intensity and (2) build and evaluate prediction models to estimate CHO utilization and EE with the same training load measures and easily quantified individual factors. Methods: This study was undertaken in two parts: a primary study, where participants performed four different laboratory-based cycle training sessions, and a validation study where different participants performed a single laboratory-based training session using one of three exercise modalities (cycling, running, or kayaking). The primary study included 15 cyclists (five female; maximal oxygen consumption [V˙O2max], 51.9 ± 7.2 mL/kg/min), the validation study included 21 cyclists (seven female; V˙O2max 53.5 ± 11.0 mL/kg/min), 20 runners (six female; V˙O2max 57.5 ± 7.2 mL/kg/min), and 18 kayakers (five female; V˙O2max 45.6 ± 4.8 mL/kg/min). Training sessions were quantified using six training load metrics: two using heart rate, three using power, and one using perceived exertion. Carbohydrate use and EE were determined separately for aerobic (gas exchange) and anaerobic (net lactate accumulation, body mass, and O2 lactate equivalent method) energy systems and summed. Repeated-measures correlations were used to examine relationships between training load and both CHO utilization and EE. General estimating equations were used to model CHO utilization and EE, using training load alongside measures of fitness and sex. Models were built in the primary study and tested in the validation study. Model performance is reported as the coefficient of determination (R2) and mean absolute error, with measures of calibration used for model evaluation and for sport-specific model re-calibration. Results: Very-large to near-perfect within-subject correlations (r = 0.76–0.96) were evident between all training load metrics and both CHO utilization and EE. In the primary study, all models explained a large amount of variance (R2 = 0.77–0.96) and displayed good accuracy (mean absolute error; CHO = 16–21 g [10–14%], EE = 53–82 kcal [7–11%]). In the validation study, the mean absolute error ranged from 16–50 g [15–45%] for CHO models to 53–182 kcal [9–31%] for EE models. The calibrated mean absolute error ranged from 9–20 g [8–18%] for CHO models to 36–72 kcal [6–12%] for EE models. Conclusions: At the individual level, there are strong linear relationships between all measures of training load and both CHO utilization and EE during cycling. When combined with other measures of fitness, EE and CHO utilization during cycling can be estimated accurately. These models can be applied in running and kayaking when used with a calibration adjustment.},

Two pretraining trials (45 and 65% of V̇O(2peak)) and two posttraining trials [same absolute workload (65% of old V̇O(2peak); ABT) and same relative workload (65% of new V̇O(2peak); RLT)] were performed using infusions of [1,1,2,3,3-2H]glycerol and [1-13C]palmitate. Pretraining rates of FFA appearance (R(a)), disappearance (R(d)), and oxidation (R(oxp)) were similar between the 65% (6.8 ± 0.6, 6.2 ± 0.7, 3.1 ± 0.3 $\mu$mol {\textperiodcentered} kg-1 {\textperiodcentered} min-1, respectively) and the 45% of V̇O(2peak) trials. At ABT and RLT training increased FFA R(a) to 8.4 ± 1.0 and 9.7 ± 1.1 $\mu$mol {\textperiodcentered} kg-1 {\textperiodcentered} min-1, R(d) to 8.3 ± 1.0 and 9.5 ± 1.1 $\mu$mol {\textperiodcentered} kg-1 {\textperiodcentered} min-1, and R(oxp) to 4.8 ± 0.4 and 6.7 ± 0.7 $\mu$mol {\textperiodcentered} kg-1 {\textperiodcentered} min-1, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). Total FFA oxidation from respiratory exchange ratio was also elevated after training at ABT and RLT, with all of the increase attributed to plasma FFA sources. Pretraining, glycerol R(a) was higher during exercise at 65 than 45% of V̇O(2peak) (6.9 ± 0.9 vs. 4.7 ± 0.6 $\mu$mol {\textperiodcentered} kg-1 {\textperiodcentered} min-1) but was not changed by training. In young women 1) plasma FFA kinetics and oxidation are not linearly related to exercise intensity before training, 2) training increases FFA R(a), R(d), and R(oxp) whether measured at given absolute or relative exercise intensities, 3) whole body lipolysis (glycerol R(a)) during exercise is not significantly impacted by training, and 4) training-induced increases in plasma FFA oxidation are the main contributor to elevated total FFA oxidation during exercise exertion after training.},

Two pretraining trials (45 and 65% of V̇O(2peak)) and two posttraining trials (same absolute workload, 65% of old V̇O(2peak); and same relative workload, 65% of new V̇o(2peak)) were performed by using an infusion of [1- 13C]palmitate and [1,1,2,3,32H]glycerol. An additional nine subjects (age 25.4 ± 0.8 yr) were treated similarly but were infused with [1,1,2,3,32H]glycerol and not [1-13C]palmitate. Subjects were studied postabsorptive for 90 min of rest and 1 h of cycling exercise. After training, subjects increased V̇O(2peak) by 9.4 ± 1.4%. Pretraining, plasma FFA kinetics were inversely related to exercise intensity with rates of appearance (R(a)) and disappearance (R(d)) being significantly higher at 45 than at 65% V̇O(2peak) (R(a): 8.14 ± 1.28 vs. 6.64 ± 0.46, R(d): 8.03 ± 1.28 vs. 6.42 ± 0.41 mol {\textperiodcentered} kg-1 {\textperiodcentered} min-1) (P ≤ 0.05).

Total fat oxidation determined from respiratory exchange ratio was elevated during exercise compared with rest, but did not differ among the four conditions. Glycerol R(a) was elevated during exercise compared with rest but did not demonstrate significant intensity or training effects during exercise.

abstract = {Chronic hypoxia has been proposed to induce a closer coupling in human skeletal muscle between ATP utilization and production in both lowlanders (LN) acclimatizing to high altitude and high-altitude natives (HAN), linked with an improved match between pyruvate availability and its use in mitochondrial respiration. This should result in less lactate being formed during exercise in spite of the hypoxaemia. To test this hypothesis six LN (22-31 years old) were studied during 15 min warm up followed by an incremental bicycle exercise to exhaustion at sea level, during acute hypoxia and after 2 and 8 weeks at 4100 m above sea level (El Alto, Bolivia). In addition, eight HAN (26-37 years old) were studied with a similar exercise protocol at altitude. The leg net lactate release, and the arterial and muscle lactate concentrations were elevated during the exercise in LN in acute hypoxia and remained at this higher level during the acclimatization period. HAN had similar high values; however, at the moment of exhaustion their muscle lactate, ADP and IMP content and Cr/PCr ratio were higher than in LN. In conclusion, sea-level residents in the course of acclimatization to high altitude did not exhibit a reduced capacity for the active muscle to produce lactate. Thus, the lactate paradox concept could not be demonstrated. High-altitude natives from the Andes actually exhibit a higher anaerobic energy production than lowlanders after 8 weeks of acclimatization reflected by an increased muscle lactate accumulation and enhanced adenine nucleotide breakdown. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.

abstract = {Although the ability to sprint repeatedly is crucial in road cycling races, the changes in aerobic and anaerobic power when sprinting during prolonged cycling has not been investigated in competitive elite cyclists. Here, we used the gross efficiency (GE)-method to investigate: (1) the absolute and relative aerobic and anaerobic contributions during 3 × 30-s sprints included each hour during a 3-h low-intensity training (LIT)-session by 12 cyclists, and (2) how the energetic contribution during 4 × 30-s sprints is affected by a 14-d high-volume training camp with (SPR, n = 9) or without (CON, n = 9) inclusion of sprints in LIT-sessions. The aerobic power was calculated based on GE determined before, after sprints, or the average of the two, while the anaerobic power was calculated by subtracting the aerobic power from the total power output. When repeating 30-s sprints, the mean power output decreased with each sprint (p < 0.001, ES:0.6–1.1), with the majority being attributed to a decrease in mean anaerobic power (first vs. second sprint: −36 ± 15 W, p < 0.001, ES:0.7, first vs. third sprint: −58 ± 16 W, p < 0.001, ES:1.0). Aerobic power only decreased during the third sprint (first vs. third sprint: −17 ± 5 W, p < 0.001, ES:0.7, second vs. third sprint: 16 ± 5 W, p < 0.001, ES:0.8). Mean power output was largely maintained between sets (first set: 786 ± 30 W vs. second set: 783 ± 30 W, p = 0.917, ES:0.1, vs. third set: 771 ± 30 W, p = 0.070, ES:0.3). After a 14-d high-volume training camp, mean power output during the 4 × 30-s sprints increased on average 25 ± 14 W in SPR (p < 0.001, ES:0.2), which was 29 ± 20 W more than CON (p = 0.008, ES: 0.3). In SPR, mean anaerobic power and mean aerobic power increased by 15 ± 13 W (p = 0.026, ES:0.2) and by 9 ± 6 W (p = 0.004, ES:0.2), respectively, while both were unaltered in CON. In conclusion, moderate decreases in power within sets of repeated 30-s sprints are primarily due to a decrease in anaerobic power and to a lesser extent in aerobic power. However, the repeated sprint-ability (multiple sets) and corresponding energetic contribution are maintained during prolonged cycling in elite cyclists. Including a small number of sprints in LIT-sessions during a 14-d training camp improves sprint-ability mainly through improved anaerobic power.},

abstract = {According to recent literature sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) has been proposed as a performance enhancing aid by reducing acidosis during exercise. The aim of the current review is to investigate if the duration of exercise is an essential factor for the effect of NaHCO3. To collect the latest studies from electronic database of PubMed, study publication time was restricted from December 2006 to December 2016. The search was updated in July 2018. The studies were divided into exercise durations of > 4 or ≤ 4 minutes for easier comparability of their effects in different exercises. Only randomized controlled trials were included in this review. Of the 775 studies, 35 met the inclusion criteria. Study design, subjects, effects as well as outcome criteria were inconsistent throughout the studies. Seventeen of these studies reported performance enhancing effects after supplementing NaHCO3. Eleven of twenty studies with exercise duration of ≤ 4 minutes showed positive and four diverse results after supplementing Na-HCO3. On the other hand six of fifteen studies with an exercise duration of >4 minutes showed performance enhancing and two studies showed diverse results. Consequently, the duration of exercise might be influential for inducing a performance enhancing effect when supplementing NaHCO3, but to which extent, remains unclear due to the inconsistencies in the study results.},

There were no differences between groups in total volume and intensity distribution of training during the intervention period. SI achieved a larger (P <.05) relative improvement in peak aerobic power output than LI (3.7 ± 4.3% vs −0.3 ± 2.8%, respectively), fractional utilization of (Formula presented.) at 4 mmol L−1 [La−] (3.0 ± 5.8 percent points vs −3.5 ± 2.7 percent points, respectively), and larger relative increase in power output at 4 mmol L−1 [La−] (2.0 ± 6.7% vs −2.8 ± 3.4, respectively), while there was no group difference in change of (Formula presented.). Improvements in performance measured as mean power output during 20-minute cycling test were greater (P <.01) in SI compared with LI (4.7 ± 4.4% vs −1.4 ± 2.2%, respectively). Mean effect size of the improvement in the above variables revealed a small to large effect of SI training vs LI training. The data thus demonstrate that the present SI protocol induces superior training adaptations compared with the present LI protocol in elite cyclists.},

abstract = {Although a considerable amount of literature exists on the ergogenic potential of  ingesting sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) before short-term, high-intensity exercise, very little exists on optimal loading times before exercise. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of NaHCO3 supplementation timing on repeated sprint ability (RSA). Eight men completed 3 (randomized and counterbalanced) trials of ten 10-second sprints separated by 50 seconds of active recovery (1:5 work-to-rest) on a nonmotorized treadmill. Before each trial, the subjects ingested 0.3 g{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1) body weight of NaHCO3 at 60 (H1), 120 (H2), or 180 (H3) minutes before exercise. Additionally, the subjects were assessed for any side effects (gastrointestinal [GI] discomfort) from the NaHCO3 ingestion via a visual analog scale (VAS). Blood buffering was assessed using a 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures, whereas repeated sprint performance and GI discomfort were assessed via a 1-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Blood-buffering capacity was not different at preexercise times (HCO3(-) [millimoles per liter] H1: 30.2 ± 0.4, H2: 30.9 ± 0.6, H3: 31.2 ± 0.6; p > 0.74). Average speed, average power, and total distance covered progressively declined over the 10 sprints; however, there was no difference between conditions (p > 0.22). The incidence of GI discomfort was significantly higher (p < 0.05) from preingestion at all time points with the exception of 180 minutes, whereas severity was only different between 90 and 180 minutes. Ingestion times (between 60 and 180 minutes) did not influence the blood buffering or the ergogenic potential of NaHCO3 as assessed by RSA. However, VAS scores indicated that at 180 minutes postingestion, an individual is less prone to experiencing significant GI discomfort.},

abstract = {High-intensity interval training (HIT), in a variety of forms, is today one of the most effective means of improving cardiorespiratory and metabolic function and, in turn, the physical performance of athletes. HIT involves repeated short-to-long bouts of rather high-intensity exercise interspersed with recovery periods. For team and racquet sport players, the inclusion of sprints and all-out efforts into HIT programmes has also been shown to be an effective practice. It is believed that an optimal stimulus to elicit both maximal cardiovascular and peripheral adaptations is one where athletes spend at least several minutes per session in their 'red zone,' which generally means reaching at least 90 % of their maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2max). While use of HIT is not the only approach to improve physiological parameters and performance, there has been a growth in interest by the sport science community for characterizing training protocols that allow athletes to maintain long periods of time above 90 % of VO2max (T@VO2max). In addition to T@VO2max, other physiological variables should also be considered to fully characterize the training stimulus when programming HIT, including cardiovascular work, anaerobic glycolytic energy contribution and acute neuromuscular load and musculoskeletal strain. Prescription for HIT consists of the manipulation of up to nine variables, which include the work interval intensity and duration, relief interval intensity and duration, exercise modality, number of repetitions, number of series, as well as the between-series recovery duration and intensity. The manipulation of any of these variables can affect the acute physiological responses to HIT. This article is Part I of a subsequent II-part review and will discuss the different aspects of HIT programming, from work/relief interval manipulation to the selection of exercise mode, using different examples of training cycles from different sports, with continued reference to T@VO2max and cardiovascular responses. Additional programming and periodization considerations will also be discussed with respect to other variables such as anaerobic glycolytic system contribution (as inferred from blood lactate accumulation), neuromuscular load and musculoskeletal strain (Part II). {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.},

abstract = {Introduction The aim of this study was to present the load, intensity, and performance characteristics of a general classification (GC) contender during multiple grand tours (GTs). This study also investigated which factors influence climbing performance. Methods Power output (PO) data were collected from a GC contender from the Vuelta a Espa{\~{n}}a 2015, the Giro d'Italia 2017, the Giro d'Italia 2018, and the Tour de France 2018. Load (e.g., Training Stress Score and kJ spent) and intensity in five PO zones were quantified. One-way ANOVA was used to identify differences between the GTs. Furthermore, performance during the four GTs was quantified based on maximal mean PO (W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) over different durations and by the relative PO (W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) on the key mountains in the GTs. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to identify which factors influence relative PO on the key mountains. Results No significant differences were found between load and intensity characteristics between the four GTs, with the exception that during the Giro d'Italia 2018, a significantly lower absolute time was spent in PO zone 5 (P = 0.005) compared with the other three GTs. The average relative PO on the key mountains (n = 33) was 5.9 ± 0.6 W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 and was negatively influenced by the duration of the climb and the total elevation gain before the key mountain, whereas the gradient of the mountain had a positive effect on relative PO. Conclusions The physiological load imposed on a GC contender did not differ between multiple GTs. Climbing performance was influenced by short-term fatigue induced by previous altitude meters in the stage and the duration and gradient of the mountain.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Anaerobic energy release is of great importance for shortlasting exercise but has been difficult to quantify. In order to determine the amount of anaerobic anergy release during shortlasting exercise we let 17 healthy young males exercise on the ergometer bike to exhaustion. The power during exercise was kept constant and selected to cause exhaustion in $\sim$30 s, 1 min, or 2-3 min. The O2 uptake was measured continuously during the exercise, and the anaerobic energy release was quantified by the accumulated O2 deficit. The work done as well as the total energy release rose linearly with the exercise duration and was therefore a sum of a component proportional to time plus a constant addition. The accumulated O2 deficit increased from 1.86 ± 0.07 (SE) mmol/kg for 30 s exercise to 2.25 ± 0.06 mmol/kg for 1 min exercise and further to 2.42 ± 0.08 mmol/kg for exercise lasting 2 min or more (P < 0.01). The accumulated O2 uptake increased linearly with the duration, and as a consequence of this the relative importance of aerobic processes increased from 40% at 30 s duration to 50% at 1 min duration and further to 65% for exercise lasting 2 min. These results show that both aerobic and anaerobic processes contribute significantly during intense exercise lasting from 30 s to 3 min.},

abstract = {Purpose Beneficial effects of carbohydrate (CHO) ingestion on exogenous CHO oxidation and endurance performance require a well-functioning gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, GI complaints are common during endurance running. This study investigated the effect of a CHO solution-containing sodium alginate and pectin (hydrogel) on endurance running performance, exogenous and endogenous CHO oxidation, and GI symptoms. Methods Eleven trained male runners, using a randomized, double-blind design, completed three 120-min steady-state runs at 68% V˙O2max, followed by a 5-km time-trial. Participants ingested 90 g{\textperiodcentered}h-1 of 2:1 glucose-fructose (13C enriched) as a CHO hydrogel, a standard CHO solution (nonhydrogel), or a CHO-free placebo during the 120 min. Fat oxidation, total and exogenous CHO oxidation, plasma glucose oxidation, and endogenous glucose oxidation from liver and muscle glycogen were calculated using indirect calorimetry and isotope ratio mass spectrometry. GI symptoms were recorded throughout the trial. Results Time-trial performance was 7.6% and 5.6% faster after hydrogel ([min:s] 19:29 ± 2:24, P < 0.001) and nonhydrogel (19:54 ± 2:23, P = 0.002), respectively, versus placebo (21:05 ± 2:34). Time-trial performance after hydrogel was 2.1% faster (P = 0.033) than nonhydrogel. Absolute and relative exogenous CHO oxidation was greater with hydrogel (68.6 ± 10.8 g, 31.9% ± 2.7%; P = 0.01) versus nonhydrogel (63.4 ± 8.1 g, 29.3% ± 2.0%; P = 0.003). Absolute and relative endogenous CHO oxidation was lower in both CHO conditions compared with placebo (P < 0.001), with no difference between CHO conditions. Absolute and relative liver glucose oxidation and muscle glycogen oxidation were not different between CHO conditions. Total GI symptoms were not different between hydrogel and placebo, but GI symptoms were higher in nonhydrogel compared with placebo and hydrogel (P < 0.001). Conclusion The ingestion of glucose and fructose in hydrogel form during running benefited endurance performance, exogenous CHO oxidation, and GI symptoms compared with a standard CHO solution.},

abstract = {Background: A typical training plan is a mix of many training sessions with different intensities and durations to achieve a specific goal, like running a marathon in a certain time. Scientific publications provide little specific information to aid in writing a comprehensive training plan. This review aims to systematically and quantitatively analyse the last 12 weeks before a marathon as recommended in 92 sub-elite training plans. Methods: We retrieved 92 marathon training plans and linked their running training sessions to five intensity zones. Subsequently, each training plan was grouped based on the total running volume in peak week into high (> 90 km/week), middle (65–90 km/week), and low (< 65 km/week) training volume plan categories. Results: In the final 12 weeks before a race, recommended weekly running volume averaged 108 km, 59 km, and 43 km for high, middle, and low distance marathon training plans. The intensity distribution of these plans followed a pyramidal training structure with 15–67–10–5–3%, 14–63–18–2–3%, and 12–67–17–2–2% in zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, for high, middle, and low volume training plans, respectively. Conclusions: By quantitatively analysing 92 recommended marathon training plans, we can specify typical recommendations for the last 12 weeks before a marathon race. Whilst this approach has obvious limitations such as no evidence for the effectiveness of the training plans investigated, it is arguably a useful strategy to narrow the gap between science and practice.},

abstract = {Purpose: To analyze professional cyclists' performance declines after, and the exercise demands during, a Grand Tour. Methods: Seven professional cyclists performed 2 incremental exercise tests, 1 wk before and the day after the Vuelta Espa{\~{n}}a. During the race the exercise demands were analyzed on the basis of heart rate (HR). Three intensity zones were established according to reference HR values corresponding to the ventilatory-(VT) and respiratory-compensation (RCT) thresholds determined during the prerace test. In addition, exercise demands for the last weeks of the Vuelta were recalculated using the reference HR determined during the postrace test for the 3rd week and averaging the change observed in the VT and RCT per stage for the 2nd week. The reference HR for the beginning of the 2nd week was estimated. Results: A significant (P-value range, .044-.000) decrement in oxygen uptake, power output, and HR at maximal exercise, VT, and RCT was found after the race. Based on the prerace test, the mean time spent daily above the RCT was 13.8 ± 10.2 min. This time decreased-1.2 min{\textperiodcentered}day-1 across the race. When the exercise intensity was corrected according to the postrace test, the time above RCT (34.1 ± 9.9 min) increased 1.0 min{\textperiodcentered}day-1. Conclusion: These data indicate that completing a Grand Tour may result in a significant decrement in maximal and submaximal endurance performance capacity. This maymodify reference values used to analyze exercise demands. As a consequence, the high-intensity exercise performed by cyclists may be underestimated.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to describe a novel training model based on lactate-guided threshold interval training (LGTIT) within a high-volume, low-intensity approach, which characterizes the training pattern in some world-class middle- and long-distance runners and to review the potential physiological mechanisms explaining its effectiveness. This training model consists of performing three to four LGTIT sessions and one VO2max intensity session weekly. In addition, low intensity running is performed up to an overall volume of 150–180 km/week. During LGTIT sessions, the training pace is dictated by a blood lactate concentration target (i.e., internal rather than external training load), typically ranging from 2 to 4.5 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L−1, measured every one to three repetitions. That intensity may allow for a more rapid recovery through a lower central and peripheral fatigue between high-intensity sessions compared with that of greater intensities and, therefore, a greater weekly volume of these specific workouts. The interval character of LGTIT allows for the achievement of high absolute training speeds and, thus, maximizing the number of motor units recruited, despite a relatively low metabolic intensity (i.e., threshold zone). This model may increase the mitochondrial proliferation through the optimization of both calcium and adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways.},

In addition, 1 repetition maximum (RM) in half-squat and 55-m maximal sprints on the cyclists' own bikes were measured before and after the 6-week intervention. Results: SST was superior to HST in 6-s sprint performance, both in a fresh state (4.7 ± 2.6% vs. 1.1 ± 3.5%) and after prolong cycling (6.1 ± 1.8% vs. 1.8 ± 4.2%), in 30-s sprint (3.7 ± 2.8% vs. 1.3 ± 2.5%) and in 55-m seated sprint on own bike (4.3 ± 2.1% vs. 0.2 ± 1.8%) (all p < 0.002). HST induced a larger 1RM improvement in the half-squat test than SST (9.3 ± 3.6% vs. −3.9 ± 3.8%; p < 0.001). No group differences were revealed in the 5-min all-out test, ˙VO2max, power output at 4 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L−1 [La− ], or in gross efficiency. Conclusion: SST led to a greater increase in average and peak power output on all sprint tests compared to HST, whereas HST led to a greater increase in maximal strength. No group differences were found in relative changes in endurance capacities. Altogether, our results show a high degree of specificity in the adaptations of both SST and HST.},

abstract = {Elite endurance athletes possess a high capacity for whole-body maximal fat oxidation (MFO). The aim was to investigate the determinants of a high MFO in endurance athletes. The hypotheses were that augmented MFO in endurance athletes is related to concomitantly increments of skeletal muscle mitochondrial volume density (MitoVD) and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAOp), that is, quantitative mitochondrial adaptations as well as intrinsic FAOp per mitochondria, that is, qualitative adaptations. Eight competitive male cross-country skiers and eight untrained controls were compared in the study. A graded exercise test was performed to determine MFO, the intensity where MFO occurs (FatMax), and VO2Max. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained to determine MitoVD (electron microscopy), FAOp, and OXPHOSp (high-resolution respirometry). The following were higher (P < 0.05) in endurance athletes compared to controls: MFO (mean [95% confidence intervals]) (0.60 g/min [0.50-0.70] vs 0.32 [0.24-0.39]), FatMax (46% VO2Max [44-47] vs 35 [34-37]), VO2Max (71 mL/min/kg [69-72] vs 48 [47-49]), MitoVD (7.8% [7.2-8.5] vs 6.0 [5.3-6.8]), FAOp (34 pmol/s/mg muscle ww [27-40] vs 21 [17-25]), and OXPHOSp (108 pmol/s/mg muscle ww [104-112] vs 69 [68-71]). Intrinsic FAOp (4.0 pmol/s/mg muscle w.w/MitoVD [2.7-5.3] vs 3.3 [2.7-3.9]) and OXPHOSp (14 pmol/s/mg muscle ww/MitoVD [13-15] vs 11 [10-13]) were, however, similar in the endurance athletes and untrained controls. MFO and MitoVD correlated (r2 = 0.504, P < 0.05) in the endurance athletes. A strong correlation between MitoVD and MFO suggests that expansion of MitoVD might be rate-limiting for MFO in the endurance athletes. In contrast, intrinsic mitochondrial changes were not associated with augmented MFO.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the changes determined by increased cadence on skeletal muscle oxygenation during cycling at an exercise intensity equal to the ventilatory threshold (T vent ). Nine healthy, active individuals with different levels of cycling experience exercised at a power output equal to T vent , pedaling at cadences of 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 rpm, each for 4 min. Cadences were tested in a randomized counterbalanced sequence. Cardiopulmonary and metabolic responses were studied using an ECG for heart rate, and gas calorimetry for pulmonary oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production. NIRS was used to determine the tissue saturation index (TSI), a measure of vastus lateralis oxygenation. TSI decreased from rest to exercise; the magnitude of this TSI reduction was significantly greater when pedaling at 90 rpm (-14±4%), compared to pedaling at 40 (-12±3%) and 50 (-12±3%) rpm (P=0.027 and 0.017, respectively). Albeit small, the significant decrease in $\Delta$TSI at increased cadence recorded in this study suggests that skeletal muscle oxygenation is relatively more affected by high cadence when exercise intensity is close to T vent .},

abstract = {Interventions aimed at increasing fat metabolism could potentially reduce the symptoms of metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes and may have tremendous clinical relevance. Hence, an understanding of the factors that increase or decrease fat oxidation is important. Exercise intensity and duration are important determinants of fat oxidation. Fat oxidation rates increase from low to moderate intensities and then decrease when the intensity becomes high. Maximal rates of fat oxidation have been shown to be reached at intensities between 59% and 64% of maximum oxygen consumption in trained individuals and between 47% and 52% of maximum oxygen consumption in a large sample of the general population. The mode of exercise can also affect fat oxidation, with fat oxidation being higher during running than cycling. Endurance training induces a multitude of adaptations that result in increased fat oxidation. The duration and intensity of exercise training required to induce changes in fat oxidation is currently unknown. Ingestion of carbohydrate in the hours before or on commencement of exercise reduces the rate of fat oxidation significantly compared with fasted conditions, whereas fasting longer than 6 h optimizes fat oxidation. Fat oxidation rates have been shown to decrease after ingestion of high-fat diets, partly as a result of decreased glycogen stores and partly because of adaptations at the muscle level. {\textcopyright} Elsevier Inc. 2004.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Sport-physiology and -performance research often relies on group designs that compare experimental and control groups and/or preintervention and postintervention results. This commentary highlights the key elements of a high-quality case study and provides clear guidelines for readers and authors of the International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance. We propose 4 essential components. First, case studies should offer relevant and original insights by tackling novel issues and defining a clear purpose. Second, they must employ rigorous methodology, encompassing careful participant selection, comprehensive data collection from diverse sources (eg, interviews, surveys, physiological tests, training diaries, competition data), and deliberate data analysis that explicitly addresses factors influencing performance changes. Third, they should be well structured and engagingly presented to reach both academic and practical audiences. Finally, bridging the science-practice gap is vital, requiring and strengthening collaboration between researchers and practitioners to enable data-driven decision making and spark new hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS: Although case studies traditionally rank low in the research evidence hierarchy, high-quality examples can significantly bridge the gap between research and practice. By working closely with the sporting community and strategically sharing findings, case studies can enhance evidence-based training strategies and amplify the real-world impact of sport science.},

abstract = {We hypothesized that reliance on lactate as a means of energy distribution is higher after a prolonged period of acclimatization (9 wk) than it is at sea level due to a higher lactate Ra and disposal from active skeletal muscle. To evaluate this hypothesis, six Danish lowlanders (25 ± 2 yr) were studied at rest and during 20 min of bicycle exercise at 146 W at sea level (SL) and after 9 wk of acclimatization to 5,260 m (Alt). Whole body glucose Ra was similar at SL and Alt at rest and during exercise. Lactate Ra was also similar for the two conditions at rest; however, during exercise, lactate Ra was substantially lower at SL (65 $\mu$mol {\textperiodcentered} min-1 {\textperiodcentered} kg body wt-1) than it was at Alt (150 $\mu$mol {\textperiodcentered} min-1 {\textperiodcentered} kg body wt-1) at the same exercise intensity. During exercise, net lactate release was ∼6-fold at Alt compared with SL, and related to this, tracer-calculated leg lactate uptake and release were both 3- or 4-fold higher at Alt compared with SL. The contribution of the two legs to glucose disposal was similar at SL and Alt; however, the contribution of the two legs to lactate Ra was significantly lower at rest and during exercise at SL (27 and 81%) than it was at Alt (45 and 123%). In conclusion, at rest and during exercise at the same absolute workload, CHO and blood glucose utilization were similar at SL and at Alt. Leg net lactate release was severalfold higher, and the contribution of leg lactate release to whole body lactate Ra was higher at Alt compared with SL. During exercise, the relative contribution of lactate oxidation to whole body CHO oxidation was substantially higher at Alt compared with SL as a result of increased uptake and subsequent oxidation of lactate by the active skeletal muscles.},

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effects of interval intensity sequencing on energy expenditure (EE), physiological markers, and perceptual responses during indoor cycling. Healthy volunteers (10 males = 20.0 ± 0.8 years; 8 females = 21.3 ± 2.7 years) completed three randomly ordered interval bouts (mixed pyramid—MP, ascending intervals—AI, descending intervals—DI) including three 3-min work bouts at 50%, 75%, and 100% of peak power output (PPO) and three 3-min recovery periods at 25% PPO. Heart rate (HR) and oxygen consumption (VO2) were expressed as percentages of maximal HR (%HRmax) and VO2 (%VO2max). EE was computed for both the work bout and for the 5-min recovery period. Session Rating of Perceived Exertion (sRPE) and Exercise Enjoyment Scale (EES) were recorded. No differences emerged for % HRmax (MP = 73.3 ± 6.1%; AI = 72.1 ± 4.9%; DI = 71.8 ± 4.5%), % VO2max (MP = 51.8 ± 4.6%; AI = 51.4 ± 3.9%; DI = 51.3 ± 4.5%), EE (MP = 277.5 ± 39.9 kcal; AI = 275.8 ± 39.4 kcal; DI = 274.9 ± 42.1 kcal), EES (MP = 4.9 ± 1.0; AI = 5.3 ± 1.1; DI = 4.9 ± 0.9), and sRPE (MP = 4.9 ± 1.0; AI = 5.3 ± 1.1; DI = 4.9 ± 0.9).

abstract = {Sodium bicarbonate ingestion before exercise has a performance-enhancing effect on high-intensity exercise. However, gastrointestinal symptoms can be a problematic side-effect. Enteric-coated sodium bicarbonate can attenuate gastrointestinal symptoms following acute bicarbonate loading. In addition, the subsequent effects on exercise performance and metabolomics have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute effect of enteric-coated sodium bicarbonate supplementation on the anaerobic performance, physiological profile, and symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort after severe-intensity intermittent exercise. At the same time, targeted metabolomics was used to study the changes in urine metabolism after ingestion of enteric-coated sodium bicarbonate and to explore the characteristics of biological metabolism. In a randomized crossover design, twelve male college students completed four Wingate anaerobic 30-s cycling tests (WACT) after consuming a placebo (PL) and two experimental conditions: 0.2 g/kg body mass in enteric-coated sodium bicarbonate pills (ES) or general sodium bicarbonate pills (GS). Blood lactate (BLA), heart rate (HR), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and gastrointestinal–symptoms assessment questionnaire (GSAQ) were measured pre-exercise and post-exercise. In contrast, mean power (MP) and peak power (PP) were recorded immediately post-exercise. Urine samples were collected before formal tests and 50 min after the third WACT. Our findings indicate the following: 1) mean power and peak power showed no significant difference among conditions (MP: F2.0, 33 = 0.541, p = 0.587, $\eta$2 = 0.032; PP: F2.0, 33 = 0.526, p = 0.596, $\eta$2 = 0.031). The PP decline of the ES and GS after the third WACT was lower than that of the PL; 2) There were no significant differences in physiological responses, such as BLA (F2.0, 33.0= 0.191, p = 0.827, $\eta$2 = 0.011) and heart rate (F2, 33 = 0.418, p = 0.662, $\eta$2 = 0.025), between the three conditions. Although blood lactate concentration after 10 min of the third WACT was lower with ES and GS than with placebo; 3) Fewer participants experienced gastrointestinal symptoms with enteric-coated than with general sodium bicarbonate; 4) The metabolites with differences among the three conditions 50 min after exercise were 3-phospho-d-glycerate, d-Glucose 6-phosphate, pyruvate, cis-aconitate, oxaloacetate, and citrate. ES had higher levels of 3-phospho-d-glycerate, d-Glucose 6-phosphate, pyruvate, and cis-aconitate than GS. The 3-phospho-d-glycerate, d-Glucose 6-phosphate, pyruvate, and cis-aconitate levels in GS were significantly lower than in PL. In contrast, the citrate level in GS was significantly higher than that in other experimental conditions. Compared to PL, the level of oxaloacetate was higher after exercise in ES. This data suggests that supplementation of enteric-coated and general sodium bicarbonate before exercise can alter energy metabolism following anaerobic exercise, involving the metabolism of 3-phospho-d-glycerate, D-Glucose 6-phosphate, pyruvate, cis-aconitate, oxaloacetate, citrate, and lactate. However, they do not affect anaerobic performance and blood lactate. The supplementation of acute enteric-coated sodium bicarbonate and general sodium bicarbonate can enhance some of the weak effects of blood lactate clearance during anaerobic exercise, which may be beneficial for glycolytic energy supply. In addition, enteric-coated sodium bicarbonate intake mitigates gastrointestinal symptoms compared to general sodium bicarbonate.},

Do haemoglobin mass and red blood cell volume increase in elite cyclists training in a hot environment compared to a control group training at normal temperature? What is the main finding and its importance? Five weeks of heat training increases haemoglobin mass in elite cyclists. There are small to intermediate effect sizes for exercise parameters favouring heat training. Abstract: In this study we tested the hypothesis that performing 1 h of regular light exercise in a heat chamber (HEAT; 37.8 ± 0.5°C; 65.4 ± 1.8% humidity) 5 times week−1 for a total of 5 weeks increases haemoglobin mass (Hbmass) and exercise performance in elite cyclists (Vo2max = 76.2 ± 7.6 ml min−1 kg−1). Twenty-three male volunteers were assigned to HEAT (n = 11) or CON (n = 12; 15.5 ± 0.1°C; 25.1 ± 0.0% humidity) training groups. Hbmass was determined before and after the intervention period in conjunction with an extensive exercise test protocol (conducted at 16–19°C). HEAT increased (P < 0.05) Hbmass by 42 g from 893 ± 78 to 935 ± 108 g whereas Hbmass remained unchanged (+6 g) in CON. Furthermore, statistical analysis revealed a time–group interaction (P < 0.05). The greater increase in Hbmass in HEAT, however, did not manifest in a greater increase in (Formula presented.) (225 ± 274 ml min−1 in HEAT and 161 ± 202 ml min−1 in CON). While HEAT reduced (P < 0.05) lactate levels during some of the submaximal exercise tests, there was no statistical difference between other performance parameters. There were, however, small to intermediate effect sizes favouring HEAT for lactate threshold power output (2.8 ± 3.9 vs. −0.4 ± 5.1% change, effect size (ES) = 0.34), gross economy in the fatigued state (0.19 ± 0.42 vs. −0.12 ± 0.49%-point change, ES = 0.52) and 15 min mean power (6.9 ± 8.4 vs. 3.4 ± 5.1% increase, ES = 0.22). This study demonstrates an increase in Hbmass and small to intermediate effect sizes on exercise variables in elite cyclists following a 5-week heat training intervention.},

Literature concerning the electromyographic analysis of pedaling is reviewed in an effort to make a synthesis of the available information, and to point out its relevance for researchers, clinicians and/or cycling/triathlon trainers. The first part of the review depicts methodological aspects of the EMG signal recording and processing. We show how the pattern of muscle activation during pedaling can be analyzed in terms of muscle activity level and muscle activation timing. Muscle activity level is generally quantified with root mean square or integrated EMG values. Muscle activation timing is studied by defining EMG signal onset and offset times that identify the duration of EMG bursts and, more recently, by the determination of a lag time maximizing the cross-correlation coefficient. In the second part of the review, we describe whether the patterns of the lower limb muscles activity are influenced by numerous factors affecting pedaling such as power output, pedaling rate, body position, shoe-pedal interface, training status and fatigue. Some research perspectives linked to pedaling performance are discussed throughout the manuscript and in the conclusion. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Studies of space-flight anemia have uncovered a physiologic process, neocytolysis, by which young red blood cells are selectively hemolyzed, allowing rapid adaptation when red cell mass is excessive for a new environment. Objectives: 1)To confirm that neocytolysis occurs in another situation of acute plethora - when high-altitude dwellers with polycythemia descend to sea level; and 2) to clarify the role of erythropoietin suppression. Design: Prospective observational and interventional study. Setting: Cerro de Pasco (4380 m) and Lima (sea level), Peru. Participants: Nine volunteers with polycythemia. Interventions: Volunteers were transported to sea level; three received low-dose erythropoietin. Measurements: Changes in red cell mass, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte count, ferritin level, serum erythropoietin, and enrichment of administered 13C in heme. Results: In six participants, red cell mass decreased by 7% to 10% within a few days of descent; this decrease was mirrored by a rapid increase in serum ferritin level. Reticulocyte production did not decrease, a finding that establishes a hemolytic mechanism. 13C changes in circulating heme were consistent with hemolysis of young cells. Erythropoietin was suppressed, and administration of exogenous erythropoietin prevented the changes in red cell mass, serum ferritin level, and 13C-heme. Conclusions: Neocytolysis and the role of erythropoietin are confirmed in persons with polycythemia who descend from high altitude. This may have implications that extend beyond space and altitude medicine to renal disease and other situations of erythropoietin suppression, hemolysis, and polycythemia.},

Red blood cell volume increased 10 ± 16% ( p = 0.029) more in BP compared to TP, while capillaries around type I fibers increased 20 ± 12% ( p = 0.002) more in TP compared to BP from Pre to Post12. No other group differences were found in time-trial (TT) performances or muscular-, or hematological adaptations. However, both groups improved 5 and 40-min TT power by 9 ± 9% ( p < 0.001) and 8 ± 9% ( p < 0.001), maximal aerobic power (W max ) and power output (PO) at 4 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L −1 blood lactate (W 4mmol ), by 6 ± 7 ( p = 0.001) and 10 ± 12% ( p = 0.001), and gross efficiency (GE) in a semi-fatigued state by 0.5 ± 1.1%-points ( p = 0.026). In contrast, GE in fresh state and VO 2peak were unaltered in both groups. The muscle protein content of $\beta$-hydroxyacyl (HAD) increased by 55 ± 58% in TP only, while both TP and BP increased the content of cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) by 72 ± 34%. Muscle enzyme activities of citrate synthase (CS) and phosphofructokinase (PFK) were unaltered. TP increased capillary-to-fiber ratio and capillary around fiber (CAF) type I by 36 ± 15% ( p < 0.001) and 17 ± 8% ( p = 0.025), respectively, while BP increased capillary density (CD) by 28 ± 24% ( p = 0.048) from Pre to Post12. The present study shows no difference in performance between BP and “best practice”-TP of endurance training intensities using a cyclic, progressively increasing training load in trained cyclists. However, hematological and muscle capillary adaptations may differ. },

abstract = {Background: The maximal rate of oxygen consumption (VO2max) is an important measure in exercise science as it is an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness. Individual studies have identified central and peripheral adaptions to interval training that may underlie improvements in VO2max, but there is no compilation of results. Objective: We aimed to systematically review the adaptive responses to high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and sprint interval training (SIT) on the central and peripheral factors influencing VO2max in healthy individuals. Data Sources: SPORTDiscus and MEDLINE (up to and including 13 June, 2020) were explored to conduct the literature search. Study Selection: Reviewed studies met the following criteria: (1) were in the English language; (2) prospective in nature; (3) included at least three interval sessions or were at least 1 week in duration; (4) contained HIIT or SIT; (5) involved participants between the ages of 18 and 65 years; and (6) included at least one of the following central (blood volume, plasma volume, hemoglobin mass, left ventricular mass, maximal stroke volume, maximal cardiac output) or peripheral factors (capillary density, maximal citrate synthase activity, mitochondrial respiration associated with VO2max). Results: Thirty-two studies (369 participants, 49 were female) were included in the quantitative analyses, consisting of both HIIT (n = 18) and SIT (n = 17) interventions. There were only statistically significant changes in hematological measures (plasma volume) following HIIT. There was a significant increase in left ventricular mass following HIIT (7.4%, p < 0.001) and SIT (5.3%, p = 0.007) in inactive individuals, though the change following SIT may be misleading. There was only a significant increase in maximal stroke volume (14.1%, p = 0.015) and maximal cardiac output (12.6%, p = 0.002) following HIIT. In addition to central factors, there was a significant increase in capillary density (13.8%, p < 0.001) following SIT in active individuals. With respect to maximal citrate synthase activity, there were improvements following HIIT (20.8%, p < 0.001) and SIT (15.7%, p < 0.001, I2 = 97%) in active individuals. The results for mitochondrial respiration suggested that there was no statistically significant improvement following HIIT (5.0%, p = 0.585). Conclusions: Improvements in the central and peripheral factors influencing VO2max were dependent on the interval type. Only HIIT led to a statistically significant improvement in cardiac function. Both HIIT and SIT increased maximal citrate synthase activity, while changes in other peripheral measures (capillary density, mitochondrial respiration) only occurred with SIT.},

abstract = {Background: Track cyclists must develop mental, physical, tactical and technical capabilities to achieve success at an elite level. Given the importance of these components in determining performance, it is of interest to understand the volume of evidence to support implementation in practice by coaches, practitioners, and athletes. Objective: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic mapping review to describe the current scale and density of research for testing, training and optimising performance in track cycling. Methods: All publications involving track cyclist participants were reviewed from four databases (PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Academic Search Complete, Cochrane Library) plus additional sources. Search results returned 4019 records, of which 71 met the inclusion criteria for the review. Results: The review revealed most published track cycling research investigated athlete testing followed by performance optimisation, with training being the least addressed domain. Research on the physical components of track cycling has been published far more frequently than for tactical or technical components, and only one study was published on the mental components of track cycling. No true experimental research using track cyclists has been published, with 51 non-experimental and 20 quasi-experimental study designs. Conclusions: Research in track cycling has been growing steadily. However, it is evident there is a clear preference toward understanding the physical—rather than mental, tactical, or technical—demands of track cycling. Future research should investigate how this aligns with coach, practitioner, and athlete needs for achieving track cycling success.

abstract = {It has been suggested that time at a high fraction (%) of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) plays a decisive role for adaptations to interval training. Yet, no study has, to date, measured the % of VO2max during all interval sessions throughout a prolonged training intervention and subsequently related it to the magnitude of training adaptations. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the relationship between % of VO2max achieved during an interval training intervention and changes in endurance performance and its physiological determinants in well-trained cyclists. Twenty-two cyclists (VO2max 67.1 (6.4) mL{\textperiodcentered}min−1 {\textperiodcentered}kg−1; males, n = 19; females, n = 3) underwent a 9-week interval training intervention, consisting 21 sessions of 5 × 8-min intervals conducted at their 40-min highest sustainable mean power output (PO). Oxygen uptake was measured during all interval sessions, and the relationship between % of VO2max during work intervals and training adaptations were investigated using linear regression. A performance index was calculated from several performance measures. With higher % of VO2max during work intervals, greater improvements were observed for maximal PO during the VO2max test (R2adjusted = 0.44, p = 0.009), PO at 4 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L−1 [blood lactate] (R2adjusted = 0.25, p = 0.035), the performance index (R2adjusted = 0.36, p = 0.013), and VO2max (R2adjusted = 0.54, p = 0.029). Other measures, such as % of maximal heart rate, were related to fewer outcome variables and exhibited poorer session-to-session repeatability compared to % of VO2max. In conclusion, improvements in endurance measures were positively related to the % of VO2max achieved during interval training. Percentage of VO2max was the measure that best reflected the magnitude of training adaptations.},

abstract = {The main goal of the current study was to compare the effects of volume-equated training frequency on gains in muscle mass and strength. In addition, we aimed to investigate whether the effect of training frequency was affected by the complexity, concerning the degrees of freedom, of an exercise. Participants were randomized to a moderate training frequency group (two weekly sessions) or high training frequency group (four weekly sessions). Twenty-one participants (male: 11, female: 10, age: 25.9 ± 4.0) completed the 9-week whole-body progressive heavy resistance training intervention with moderate (n = 13) or high (n = 8) training frequency. Whole-body and regional changes in lean mass were measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, while the vastus lateralis thickness was measured by ultrasound. Changes in muscle strength were measured as one repetition maximum for squat, hack squat, bench press, and chest press. No differences between groups were observed for any of the measures of muscle growth or muscle strength. Muscle strength increased to a greater extent in hack squat and chest press than squat and bench press for both moderate (50 and 21% vs. 19 and 14%, respectively) and high-frequency groups (63 and 31% vs. 19 and 16%, respectively), with no differences between groups. These results suggest that training frequency is less decisive when weekly training volume is equated. Further, familiarity with an exercise seems to be of greater importance for strength adaptations than the complexity of the exercise.},

abstract = {Introduction: Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) ingestion has been found to be ergogenic in high-intensity exercise that ranges from 1 to 10 min; however, limited studies have investigated high-intensity exercise beyond this duration. Purpose: The present study aimed to determine the effect of NaHCO3 ingested using a carbohydrate hydrogel delivery system on 40 km time trial (TT) performance in trained male cyclists. Methods: Fourteen trained male cyclists ingested 0.3 g kg−1 BM NaHCO3 (Maurten AB, Sweden) to determine individualised peak alkalosis, which established time of ingestion prior to exercise. Participants completed a 40 km familiarisation TT, and two 40 km experimental TTs after ingestion of either NaHCO3 or placebo in a randomised, double-blind, crossover design. Results: NaHCO3 supplementation improved performance (mean improvement = 54.14 s ± 18.16 s; p = 0.002, g = 0.22) and increased blood buffering capacity prior to (HCO3− mean increase = 5.6 ± 0.2 mmol L−1, p < 0.001) and throughout exercise (f = 84.82, p < 0.001, p$\eta$2 = 0.87) compared to placebo. There were no differences in total gastrointestinal symptoms (GIS) between conditions either pre- (NaHCO3, 22 AU; Placebo, 44 AU; p = 0.088, r = 0.46) or post-exercise (NaHCO3, 76 AU; Placebo, 63 AU; p = 0.606, r = 0.14). Conclusion: The present study suggests that ingesting NaHCO3 mini-tablets in a carbohydrate hydrogel can enhance 40 km TT performance in trained male cyclists, with minimal GIS. This ingestion strategy could therefore be considered by cyclists looking for a performance enhancing ergogenic aid.},

abstract = {The ability of the cardiorespiratory system (heart, lungs, blood) to deliver oxygen to exercising skeletal muscle constrains maximum oxygen consumption V̇ O2max, with cardiac output and the concentration of oxygen-carrying haemoglobin ([Hb]) being key limiting parameters. Total blood volume (BV) is the sum of the plasma volume (PV) and the total red cell volume. The measured [Hb] is dependent upon the total circulating mass of haemoglobin (tHb-mass) and plasma volume (PV). While the proportion of oxygen carried in plasma is trivial (0.3 mL of oxygen per 100 mL of plasma), each gram of Hb, contained in red blood cells, binds 1.39 mL of oxygen. As a result, the relationship between V̇ O2max and tHb-mass is stronger than that observed between V ̇ O2max and [Hb] or BV. The glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin drives red cell synthesis and, like simple transfusion of packed red blood cells, can increase tHb-mass. An iron-containing haem group lies at the centre of the Hb molecule and, in situations of actual or functional iron deficiency, tHb-mass will also rise following iron administration. However achieved, an increase in tHb-mass also increases circulating oxygen-carrying capacity, and thus the capacity for aerobic phosphorylation. It is for such reasons that alterations in V̇ O2max and exercise performance are proportional to those in arterial oxygen content and systemic oxygen transport, a change in tHb-mass of 1 g being associated with a 4 mL {\textperiodcentered} min-1 change in V̇ O2max. Similarly, V̇ O2max increases by approximately 1% for each 3 g {\textperiodcentered} L-1 increase in [Hb] over the [Hb] range (120 to 170 g {\textperiodcentered} L-1). Surgery, like exercise, places substantial metabolic demands on the patient. Whilst subject to debate, oxygen supply at a rate inadequate to prevent muscle anaerobiosis may underpin the occurrence of the anaerobic threshold (AT), an important submaximal marker of cardiorespiratory fitness. Preoperatively, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) can be used to determine AT and peak exertional oxygen uptake (V̇ O2 peak) as measures of ability to meet increasing oxygen demands. The degree of surgical insult and the ability to meet the resulting additional postoperative oxygen demand appear to be fundamental determinants of surgical outcome: individuals in whom such ability is impaired (and thus those with reduced V̇ O2 peak and AT) are at greater risk of adverse surgical outcome. This review provides an overview of the relationships between [Hb], tHb-mass, exercise capacity, and surgical outcome and discusses the potential value of assessing tHb-mass over [Hb]. {\textcopyright} 2013 Otto et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract: There is a lack of knowledge regarding the contribution of central and peripheral factors to the increases in VO2max following sprint-interval training (SIT). This study investigated the importance of maximal cardiac output (Qmax) in relation to VO2max improvements following SIT and the relative importance of the hypervolemic response on Qmax and VO2max. We also investigated whether systemic O2 extraction increased with SIT as has been previously suggested. Healthy men and women (n = 9) performed 6 weeks of SIT. State-of-the-art measurements: right heart catheterization, carbon monoxide rebreathing and respiratory gas exchange analysis were used to assess Qmax, arterial O2 content (caO2), mixed venous O2 content (cvO2), blood volume (BV) and VO2max before and after the intervention. In order to assess the relative contribution of the hypervolemic response to the increases in VO2max, BV was re-established to pre-training levels by phlebotomy. Following the intervention, VO2max, BV and Qmax increased by 11% (P < 0.001), 5.4% (P = 0.013) and 8.8% (P = 0.004), respectively. cvO2 decreased by 12.4% (P = 0.011) and systemic O2 extraction increased by 4.0% (P = 0.009) during the same period, both variables were unaffected by phlebotomy (P = 0.589 and P = 0.548, respectively). After phlebotomy, VO2max and Qmax reverted back to pre-intervention values (P = 0.064 and P = 0.838, respectively) and were significantly lower compared with post-intervention (P = 0.016 and P = 0.018, respectively). The decline in VO2max after phlebotomy was linear to the amount of blood removed (P = 0.007, R = −0.82). The causal relationship between BV, Qmax and VO2max shows that the hypervolemic response is a key mediator of the increases in VO2max following SIT. (Figure presented.). Key points: Sprint-interval training (SIT) is an exercise model involving supramaximal bouts of exercise interspersed with periods of rest known for its efficiency in improving maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). In contrast to the commonly accepted view where central haemodynamic adaptations are considered to be the key mediators of increases in VO2max there have been propositions highlighting peripheral adaptations as the main mediators in the context of SIT-induced changes in VO2max. By combining right heart catheterization, carbon monoxide rebreathing and phlebotomy, this study shows that increases in maximal cardiac output due to the expansion of the total blood volume is a major explanatory factor for the improvement in VO2max following SIT, with a smaller contribution from improved systemic oxygen extraction. The present work not only clarifies a controversy in the field by using state-of-the-art methods, but also encourages future research to investigate regulatory mechanisms that could explain how SIT can lead to improvements in VO2max and maximal cardiac output similar to those that have previously been reported for traditional endurance exercise.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 3 weeks with three weekly sessions (ie, nine sessions in total) of short intervals (SI; n = 9; 3 series with 13 × 30-second work intervals interspersed with 15-second recovery and 3-minutes recovery between series) against effort-matched (rate of perceived effort based) long intervals (LI; n = 9; 4 series of 5-minute work intervals with 2.5-minutes recovery between series) on performance parameters in elite cyclists ((Formula presented.) 73 ± 4 mL min−1 kg−1). There were no differences between groups in total volume and intensity distribution of training during the intervention period. SI achieved a larger (P <.05) relative improvement in peak aerobic power output than LI (3.7 ± 4.3% vs −0.3 ± 2.8%, respectively), fractional utilization of (Formula presented.) at 4 mmol L−1 [La−] (3.0 ± 5.8 percent points vs −3.5 ± 2.7 percent points, respectively), and larger relative increase in power output at 4 mmol L−1 [La−] (2.0 ± 6.7% vs −2.8 ± 3.4, respectively), while there was no group difference in change of (Formula presented.). Improvements in performance measured as mean power output during 20-minute cycling test were greater (P <.01) in SI compared with LI (4.7 ± 4.4% vs −1.4 ± 2.2%, respectively). Mean effect size of the improvement in the above variables revealed a small to large effect of SI training vs LI training. The data thus demonstrate that the present SI protocol induces superior training adaptations compared with the present LI protocol in elite cyclists.},

abstract = {By blocking the oxygen binding sites on the hemoglobin molecule, chronic low-dose carbon monoxide (CO) administration may produce similar effects to those of exposure to altitude. Purpose This study aimed to determine the effect of chronic low-dose CO application on hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) and V˙O2max. Methods For 3 wk, 11 healthy and moderately trained male subjects inhaled a CO bolus five times per day to increase their HbCO concentration by 5%. Another 11 subjects received a placebo. Hbmass, serum erythropoietin concentration, ferritin, and basic hematological parameters were determined before and weekly during and until 3 wk after the CO inhalation period. V˙O2max tests on a cycle ergometer were performed before and after the CO administration period. Results In the CO group, Hbmass increased from 919 ± 69 to 962 ± 78 g in week 3 (P < 0.001) and was maintained for the following 3 wk. Reticulocytes (%) and immature reticulocyte fraction significantly increased after 1 wk. Serum erythropoietin concentration tended to increase after 1 wk (P = 0.07) and was suppressed in the postperiod (P < 0.01). Ferritin decreased during the inhalation period (from 106 ± 37 to 72 ± 37 ng{\textperiodcentered}mL-1, P < 0.001). V˙O2max tended to increase from 4230 ± 280 to 4350 ± 350 mL{\textperiodcentered}min-1 (P < 0.1) immediately after the inhalation period and showed a significant relationship to the change in Hbmass (y = 4.1x - 73.4, r = 0.70, P < 0.001). Conclusions Chronic continuous exposure to low-dose CO enhances erythropoietic processes resulting in a 4.8% increase in Hbmass. The individual changes in Hbmass were correlated to the corresponding changes in V˙O2max. Examination of ethical and safety concerns is warranted before the implementation of low-dose CO inhalation in the clinical/athletic setting as a tool for modifying Hbmass.},

abstract = {The 'cycling hour-record' is one of the most prestigious events in cycling.  However, little detailed analysis of such attempts is available. In preparation for a successful cycling hour-record attempt, an elite cyclist performed a full-hour simulation to provide insights into performance, physiological, aerodynamic and biomechanical limitations that could be identified in the preparation for a subsequent official attempt. Performance (speed, lap time, power and cadence), physiological (heart rate and estimated body temperature), aerodynamic (C(D)A, helmet angle, rotation and rock) and biomechanical (helmet, thigh and foot position changes) measurements were made throughout the attempt, in which an even-pacing strategy was employed where the point of task failure was defined as the lap which the rider could no longer perform at the targeted lap split (16.6 s) or quicker. The cyclist did not achieve the target distance (54,000 m) during the simulation. The final distance achieved for the hour was 53,250 m. Task failure occurred at 38 min and 33 s (lap 139/34,750 m) into the simulation. Notably, there was a decrease in power output, accompanied with an increase in the estimated body temperature, changes in pedalling kinematics and an increase in aerodynamic drag. The reduction in performance (leading to task failure) during a cycling hour record simulation is underpinned by a decrease in power output as well as an increase in aerodynamic drag due to biomechanical changes in the cycling technique.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Endurance athletes tend to accumulate large training volumes, the majority of which are performed at a low intensity and a smaller portion at moderate and high intensity. However, different training intensity distributions (TID) are employed to maximize physiological and performance adaptations. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and network meta-analysis of individual participant data to compare the effect of different TID models on maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and time-trial (TT) performance in endurance-trained athletes. METHODS Studies were included if: (1) they were published in peer reviewed academic journals, (2) they were in English, (3) they were experimental or quasi-experimental studies, (4) they included trained endurance athletes, (5) they compared a polarized (POL) TID intervention to a comparator group that utilized a different TID model, (6) the duration in each intensity domain could be quantified, and (7) they reported VO2max or TT performance. Medline and SPORTDiscus were searched from inception until 11 February 2024. RESULTS We included 13 studies with 348 (n = 296 male, n = 52 female) recreational (n = 150) and competitive (n = 198) endurance athletes. Mean age ranged from 17.6 to 41.5 years and VO2max ranged from 46.6 to 68.3 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1, across studies respectively. Based on the time in heart rate zone approach, there was no difference in VO2max (SMD = - 0.06, p = 0.68) or TT performance (SMD = - 0.05, p = 0.34) between POL and pyramidal (PYR) interventions. There were no statistically significant differences between POL and any of the other TID interventions. Subgroup analysis showed a statistically significant difference in the response of VO2max between recreational and competitive athletes for POL and PYR (SMD = - 0.63, p < 0.05). Competitive athletes may have greater improvements to VO2max with POL, while recreational athletes may improve more with a PYR TID. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that the adaptations to VO2max following different TID interventions are dependent on performance level. Athletes at a more competitive level may benefit from a POL TID intervention and recreational athletes from a PYR TID intervention.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a 6-day high-intensity interval (HIT) block [BLOCK, n = 12, maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max = 69. 6 ± 4.3 mL{\textperiodcentered}min−1{\textperiodcentered}kg−1)] with a time-matched period with usual training (CON, n = 12, V̇O2max = 69.2 ± 4.2 mL{\textperiodcentered}min−1{\textperiodcentered}kg−1) in well-trained cross-country (XC) skiers on physiological determinants and indicators of endurance performance. Furthermore, the study aimed to investigate the acute physiological responses, including time ≥90% of V̇O2max, and its associated reliability during repeated HIT sessions in the HIT microcycle. Methods: Before the 6-day HIT block and following 5 days of recovery after the HIT block, both groups were tested on indicators of endurance performance. To quantify time ≥90% of V̇O2max during interval sessions in the HIT block, V̇O2 measurements were performed on the 1st, 2nd, and last HIT session in BLOCK. Results: BLOCK had a larger improvement than CON in maximal 1-min velocity achieved during the V̇O2max test (3.1 ± 3.1% vs. 1.2 ± 1.6%, respectively; p = 0.010) and velocity corresponding to 4 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L−1 blood lactate (3.2 ± 2.9% vs. 0.6 ± 2.1%, respectively; p = 0.024). During submaximal exercise, BLOCK displayed a larger reduction in respiratory exchange ratio, blood lactate concentration, heart rate, and rate of perceived exertion (p < 0.05) and a tendency towards less energy expenditure compared to CON (p = 0.073). The ICC of time ≥90% V̇O2max in the present study was 0.57, which indicates moderate reliability. Conclusions: In well-trained XC skiers, BLOCK induced superior changes in indicators of endurance performance compared with CON, while time ≥90% of V̇O2max during the HIT sessions in the 6-day block had a moderate reliability.},

Testing protocols, performed during a pre-season training camp, included maximal efforts across varied gear ratios and durations (15 s, 3 min, and 12 min), under stable environmental conditions (15–20°C). Results revealed reduced power output, torque, and cadence after accumulated work compared to fresh conditions (p ≤.001). Sprint-derived maximum torque (Tmax) was strongly correlated with torque intercepts for CP fresh (r =.558, p =.020) and after accumulated work (r =.556, p =.020). The cadence relationships demonstrated a large negative correlation between maximum cadence (Cmax) and optimum cadence (Copt) from the sprint test and the 15 s, 3 min and 12 min cadence recorded during CP after accumulated work (r = -0.541 to −0.634, p = 0.006 to 0.025). These findings highlight that accumulated work-induced reductions in work capacity (W') and CP values were accompanied by lower cadences across all effort durations.},

abstract = {This study was designed to quantify the daily distribution of training intensity in a group of well-trained junior cross-country skiers and compare the results of three different methods of training intensity quantification. Eleven male athletes performed treadmill tests to exhaustion to determine heart rate and VO2 corresponding to ventilatory thresholds (VT1, VT2), maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), and maximal heart rate. VT1 and VT2 were used to delineate three intensity zones. During the same time period, all training sessions (N=384, 37 strength training, 347 endurance) performed over 32 consecutive days were quantified using continuous heart rate registration and session Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE). In addition, a subset of 60 consecutive training sessions was quantified using blood lactate measurements. Intensity distribution across endurance training sessions (n=318) was similar when based on heart rate analysis (75±3%, zone 1; 8±3%, zone 2; 17±4%, zone 3) or session RPE (76±4%, zone 1; 6±5%, zone 2; 18±7%, zone 3). Similarly, from measurements of 60 consecutive sessions, 71% were performed with ≤2.0 mM blood lactate, 7% between 2 and 4 mM, and 22% with over 4 mM (mean=9.5±2.8 mM). In this group of nationally competitive junior skiers, training was organized after a polarized pattern, with most sessions performed clearly below (about 75%) or with substantial periods above (15-20%) the lactate accommodation zone, which is bounded by VT1 and VT2. The pattern quantified here is similar to that reported in observational studies of elite endurance athletes across several sports. It appears that elite endurance athletes train surprisingly little at the lactate threshold intensity. Copyright {\textcopyright} Blackwell Munksgaard 2004.},

abstract = {HIIT prescriptions manipulate intensity, duration, and recovery variables in multiple combinations. Researchers often compare different HIIT variable combinations and treat HIIT prescription as a “maximization problem,” seeking to identify the prescription(s) that induce the largest acute VO2/HR/RPE response. However, studies connecting the magnitude of specific acute HIIT response variables like work time >90% of VO2max and resulting cellular signalling and/or translation to protein upregulation and performance enhancement are lacking. This is also not how successful endurance athletes train. First, HIIT training cannot be seen in isolation. Successful endurance athletes perform most of their training volume below the first lactate turn point (<LT1), with “threshold training” and HIIT as integrated parts of a synergistic combination of training intensities and durations. Second, molecular signalling research reveals multiple, “overlapping” signalling pathways driving peripheral adaptations, with those pathways most sensitive to work intensity showing substantial feedback inhibition. This makes current training content and longer-term training history critical modulators of HIIT adaptive responses. Third, long term maximization of endurance capacity extends over years. Successful endurance athletes balance low intensity and high intensity, low systemic stress, and high systemic stress training sessions over time. The endurance training process is therefore an “optimization problem.” Effective HIIT sessions generate both cellular signal and systemic stress that each individual athlete responds to and recovers from over weeks, months, and even years of training. It's not “epic” HIIT sessions but effective integration of intensity, duration, and frequency of all training stimuli over time that drives endurance performance success.},

However, none of these have reviewed if there are any sex differences in the effects of concurrent training on cycling performance, and most research in this area has been performed with male cyclists. Thus, the aim of the current paper is to review the scientific literature on the effect of concurrent training on cycling performance in male and female cyclists with a special emphasis on potential sex differences. The results indicate that both male and female cyclists experience a similar beneficial effect from concurrent training on cycling performance and its physiological determinants compared to normal endurance training only. Some data indicate that women have a larger effect on cycling economy, but more studies are needed to explore this further. Furthermore, the adaptations to strength training thought to be responsible for the beneficial effects on cycling performance seem to be very similar between men and women. Interestingly, increased muscle cross-sectional area in the main locomotor muscles seems to be an important adaptation for improved performance, and, contrary to popular belief, cyclists should aim for increased muscle cross-sectional area when adding strength training to their normal training. We conclude that both male and female cyclists can improve their cycling performance by adding strength training to their normal training.},

abstract = {Purpose Altitude training is a common strategy used with the intent to increase hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) in athletes. However, if the Hbmass is increased during altitude camps it seems to decline rapidly upon returning to sea level. This study aimed to examine the efficacy of three weekly heat training sessions over a 3.5-week period following a 3-week altitude camp, on the maintenance of Hbmass in elite cyclists. Methods Eighteen male cyclists (maximal oxygen consumption: 76 ± 5 mL{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) underwent a 3-week altitude training camp at ∼2100 m above sea level. After the camp, participants were divided into one group performing three weekly heat sessions that was subtracted from their usual training (HEAT) while the other continuing usual training (CON). Training characteristics were recorded during the intervention, while hematological measurements were recorded before the camp as well as two days and 3.5-weeks after the altitude camp. Results The 3-week altitude camp led to an overall increase in total Hbmass of 4.1%. Afterwards, HEAT maintained Hbmass (0.2%, p = 0.738), while CON group experienced a significant reduction (-3.3%, p < 0.001) ($\Delta$HEAT vs. $\Delta$CON, p < 0.001). Moreover, HEAT increased plasma volume (PV) by 11.6% (p = 0.007) and blood volume (BV) by 5.8% (p = 0.007), whereas CON only showed an increase in PV (5.5%, p = 0.041). Exercise intensity and training load were not different between groups during the maintenance period. Conclusions This study suggests that incorporating three weekly heat training sessions into the usual training routine preserves a moderately increased Hbmass in elite cyclists following an altitude camp.},

abstract = {Acute exposure to moderate altitude is likely to enhance cycling performance on flat terrain because the benefit of reduced aerodynamic drag outweighs the decrease in maximum aerobic power [maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max)]. In contrast, when the course is mountainous, cycling performance will be reduced at moderate altitude. Living and training at altitude, or living in an hypoxic environment ($\sim$2500m) but training near sea level, are popular practices among elite cyclists seeking enhanced performance at sea level. In an attempt to confirm or refute the efficacy of these practices, we reviewed studies conducted on highly-trained athletes and, where possible, on elite cyclists. To ensure relevance of the information to the conditions likely to be encountered by cyclists, we concentrated our literature survey on studies that have used 2- to 4-week exposures to moderate altitude (1500 to 3000m). With acclimatisation there is strong evidence of decreased production or increased clearance of lactate in the muscle, moderate evidence of enhanced muscle buffering capacity ($\beta$m) and tenuous evidence of improved mechanical efficiency (ME) of cycling. Our analysis of the relevant literature indicates that, in contrast to the existing paradigm, adaptation to natural or simulated moderate altitude does not stimulate red cell production sufficiently to increase red cell volume (RCV) and haemoglobin mass (Hbmass). Hypoxia does increase serum erthyropoietin levels but the next step in the erythropoietic cascade is not clearly established; there is only weak evidence of an increase in young red blood cells (reticulocytes).Moreover, the collective evidence from studies of highly-trained athletes indicates that adaptation to hypoxia is unlikely to enhance sea level V̇O2max. Such enhancement would be expected if RCV and Hbmass were elevated. The accumulated results of 5 different research groups that have used controlled study designs indicate that continuous living and training at moderate altitude does not improve sea level performance of high level athletes. However, recent studies from 3 independent laboratories have consistently shown small improvements after living in hypoxia and training near sea level. While other research groups have attributed the improved performance to increased RCV and V̇O2max, we cite evidence that changes at the muscle level ($\beta$m and ME) could be the fundamental mechanism. While living at altitude but training near sea level may be optimal for enhancing the performance of competitive cyclists, much further research is required to confirm its benefit. If this benefit does exist, it probably varies between individuals and averages little more than 1%.},

abstract = {We formulate an optimization of a bicycle ascent time under the constraints of the average, maximum, and minimum powers. In contrast to the first part of this study, we do not restrict the departure to flying starts with an initial speed determined by the model and its optimization. We allow for various initial speeds, from a standstill to a launched start. We accomplish this by generalizing the discontinuous piecewise constant speed model to a continuous piecewise linear speed model. Regardless of the initial speed, steepness or profile of the ascent the optimal strategy tends to a constant ground speed, in agreement with the conclusion of the previous, more restricted, formulation. This new formulation allows us to compare various initial-speed strategies and, hence, has a direct application to competitive cycling. Notably, in timetrials composed of flat and steep sections, it helps one decide whether or not to change bicycle, which requires stopping and restarting, from one that is more appropriate for flats to one that is more appropriate for uphills.},

abstract = {The balance between protein synthesis and degradation, and between active skeletal muscle cell hypertrophy and atrophy can be described as a function of protein degradation rate by a transcription-translation activation control loop. Transcription activity is presumed to be determined by the concentration of protein-specific fragments (PSF) occurring as intermediate products of protein degradation. If PSF acts as an apoinducer at the gene or operon enhancer region, formation and dissociation of PSF-enhancer complex, as a function of PSF concentration, determines the gene or operon transcription activity. The assumed regulation can be converted to a mathematical model that allows simulation of steady-state protein balance and active adaptation, according to the level of functional activity. The relationship between steady-state transcription activity and PSF concentration can be described by Michaelis-Menten or weak sigmoidicity kinetics. Similar dependency is presumed in translation activity as a function of mRNA concentration. The relationship of protein to mRNA, PSF and ribosome content, and their formation and degradation, are determined by first-order differential equations. The assumed regulation scheme may also contribute to the theory of transcription activation, and can be used to explain the mechanism determining active adaptation in living systems. {\textcopyright} 1988 Academic Press Limited.},

At the time he became World Champion he also achieved among the highest reported maximal oxygen uptake (V O2max) value, 96.7 ml{\textperiodcentered}min1{\textperiodcentered}kg1, or 7,397 ml/min in absolute terms at 76.5 kg, which had increased by 29.6% from 74.6 ml{\textperiodcentered}min1{\textperiodcentered}kg1 pre-bike-specific training. After 15 mo with almost no structured exercise training, V O2max returned to 77.0 mL{\textperiodcentered}min1{\textperiodcentered}kg1 and was similar to the value reported before specific bike training, albeit with absolute term (6,205 ml/min) still being 11.3% higher. Part of the explanation for his athletic achievements is likely also related to the up to 20.9% improvement in Power@4 mmol/l (W). Although genetic profiles of endurance athletes have not generated data suggesting a shared genetic signature associated with elite endurance performance, this case study highlights the importance of intrinsic biological factors in elite endurance performance. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study shows that very high V O2max values (70 ml{\textperiodcentered}min1{\textperiodcentered}kg1) can be found in individuals not previously specializing in aerobic training and that values of 90 ml{\textperiodcentered} min1{\textperiodcentered}kg1, as well as a cycling world junior champion title, can be achieved in such individuals with just 3 yr of dedicated exercise training.},

abstract = {Purpose: The authors directly compared 3 frequently used methods of heart-rate-based training-intensity-distribution (TID) quantification in a large sample of training sessions performed by elite endurance athletes. Methods: Twenty-nine elite cross-country skiers (16 male, 13 female; 25 ± 4 y; 70 ± 11 kg; 76 ± 7 mL {\textperiodcentered} min-1 {\textperiodcentered} kg -1 VO2max) conducted 570 training sessions during a ∼14-d altitude-training camp. Three analysis methods were used: time in zone (TIZ), session goal (SG), and a hybrid session-goal/time-in-zone (SG/TIZ) approach. The proportion of training in zone 1, zone 2, and zone 3 was quantified using total training time or frequency of sessions, and simple conversion factors across different methods were calculated. Results: Comparing the TIZ and SG/TIZ methods, 96.1% and 95.5%, respectively, of total training time was spent in zone 1 (P < .001), with 2.9%/3.6% and 1.1%/0.8% in zones 2/3 (P < .001). Using SG, this corresponded to 86.6% zone 1 and 11.1%/2.4% zone 2/3 sessions. Estimated conversion factors from TIZ or SG/TIZ to SG and vice versa were 0.9/1.1, respectively, in the low-intensity training range (zone 1) and 3.0/0.33 in the high-intensity training range (zones 2 and 3). Conclusions: This study provides a direct comparison and practical conversion factors across studies employing different methods of TID quantification associated with the most common heart-rate-based analysis methods. {\textcopyright} 2014 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

abstract = {Fatigue resistance is vital for success in elite road cycling, as repeated, intense efforts challenge the athletes' ability to sustain peak performance throughout prolonged races. The present study combined recurrent performance testing and physiological measures during 6 h simulated racing with laboratory testing to investigate factors influencing fatigue resistance. Twelve male national elite cyclists (25 ± 3 years; 76 ± 6 kg and VO2max of 5.2 ± 0.5 L/min) completed incremental power and maximal fat oxidation tests. Subsequently, they underwent field testing with physiological measures and fatigue responses evaluated through peak sprint power and 5 km time trial (TT) testing after 0, 2, 4, and 6 h of exercise. Peak power declined from 1362 ± 176 W in first sprint to 1271 ± 152 W after 2 h (p < 0.01) and then stabilized. In contrast, TT mean power gradually declined from 412 ± 38 W in the first TT to 384 ± 41 W in the final trial, with individual losses ranging from 2% to 14% and moderately correlated (r2 = 0.45) to accumulated exercise time above lactate threshold. High carbohydrate intake ($\sim$90 g/h) maintained blood glucose levels, but post-TT [lactate] decreased from 15.1 ± 2 mM to 7.1 ± 2.3 mM, while fat oxidation increased from 0.7 ± 0.3 g/min at 0 h to 1.1 ± 0.1 g/min after 6 h. The study identifies fatigue patterns in national elite cyclists. Peak sprint power stabilized after an initial impairment from 0 to 2 h, while TT power gradually declined over the 6 h simulated race, with increased differentiation in fatigue responses among athletes.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of adding heavy strength training to well-trained female cyclists' normal endurance training on cycling performance. Nineteen female cyclists were randomly assigned to 11 weeks of either normal endurance training combined with heavy strength training (E+S, n=11) or to normal endurance training only (E, n=8). E+S increased one repetition maximum in one-legged leg press and quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) more than E (P<0.05), and improved mean power output in a 40-min all-out trial, fractional utilization of VO2max and cycling economy (P<0.05). The proportion of type IIAX-IIX muscle fibers in m. vastus lateralis was reduced in E+S with a concomitant increase in type IIA fibers (P<0.05). No changes occurred in E. The individual changes in performance during the 40-min all-out trial was correlated with both change in IIAX-IIX fiber proportion (r=-0.63) and change in muscle CSA (r=0.73). In conclusion, adding heavy strength training improved cycling performance, increased fractional utilization of VO2max, and improved cycling economy. The main mechanisms behind these improvements seemed to be increased quadriceps muscle CSA and fiber type shifts from type IIAX-IIX toward type IIA.},

abstract = {This study evaluated relationships between changes in training load, haematological responses, and endurance exercise performance during temperate and heat acclimation (HA) training preceding a male team cycling pursuit world record (WR). Haemoglobin mass (Hbmass) and concentration ([Hb]), plasma volume (PV) and blood volume (BV) were assessed in nine male track endurance cyclists (∼3 occasions per month) training in temperate conditions (247–142 days prior to the WR) to establish responses to differing acute (ATL) and chronic (CTL) training loads. Testing was performed again pre- and post-HA (22–28 days prior to the WR). Endurance performance (V̇O₂max, 4MMP, lactate threshold 1 and 2) was assessed on three occasions (238–231, 189–182 and 133–126 days prior to the WR). In temperate conditions, CTL was associated with Hbmass (B = 0.62, P = 0.02), PV (B = 4.49, P = 0.01) and BV (B = 6.51, P = 0.04) but not [Hb] (B = −0.01, P = 0.17). ATL was associated with PV (B = 2.28, P < 0.01), BV (B = 2.63, P = 0.04) and [Hb] (B = −0.01, P = 0.04) but not Hbmass (B = 0.10, P = 0.41). During HA, PV increased 8.2% (P < 0.01), while Hbmass, CTL and ATL were unchanged. Hbmass and [Hb] were associated with all performance outcomes (P < 0.05), except V̇O2max. PV and BV were not associated with performance outcomes. During temperate training, changes in Hbmass were most strongly associated with changes in CTL. Both CTL and ATL were associated with changes in PV, but HA was associated with increased PV and maintenance of Hbmass without increasing ATL or CTL. In practical terms, maintaining high CTL and high Hbmass might be beneficial for improving endurance performance. HIGHLIGHTS Changes in haemoglobin mass were associated with endurance exercise performance and changes in chronic training load in temperate conditions. Heat acclimation increased plasma volume and maintained haemoglobin mass independently of chronic training load. Chronic training loads and haemoglobin mass should be increased to improve endurance exercise performance. Heat acclimation may optimise haematological adaptations when training load is reduced.},

In order to determine the amount of anaerobic anergy release during shortlasting exercise we let 17 healthy young males exercise on the ergometer bike to exhaustion. The power during exercise was kept constant and selected to cause exhaustion in $\sim$30 s, 1 min, or 2-3 min. The O2 uptake was measured continuously during the exercise, and the anaerobic energy release was quantified by the accumulated O2 deficit. The work done as well as the total energy release rose linearly with the exercise duration and was therefore a sum of a component proportional to time plus a constant addition. The accumulated O2 deficit increased from 1.86 ± 0.07 (SE) mmol/kg for 30 s exercise to 2.25 ± 0.06 mmol/kg for 1 min exercise and further to 2.42 ± 0.08 mmol/kg for exercise lasting 2 min or more (P < 0.01). The accumulated O2 uptake increased linearly with the duration, and as a consequence of this the relative importance of aerobic processes increased from 40% at 30 s duration to 50% at 1 min duration and further to 65% for exercise lasting 2 min. These results show that both aerobic and anaerobic processes contribute significantly during intense exercise lasting from 30 s to 3 min.},

We also assessed whether fatigue could differently affect cyclists of 2 competition categories. Methods: We analyzed the record power profile in 112 professional cyclists (n = 46 and n = 66 in the ProTeam [PT] and WorldTour [WT] category, respectively; age 29 [6] y, 8 [5] y experience in the professional category) during 2013–2021 (8 [5] seasons/cyclist). We analyzed their mean maximal power (MMP) values for efforts lasting 10 seconds to 120 minutes with no fatigue (after 0 kJ{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) and with increasing levels of fatigue (after 15, 25, 35, and 45 kJ{\textperiodcentered}kg-1). Results: A significant (P < .001) and progressive deterioration of all MMP values was observed from the lowest levels of fatigue assessed (ie, -1.6% to -3.0% decline after 15 kJ{\textperiodcentered}kg-1, and -6.0% to -9.7% after 45 kJ{\textperiodcentered}kg-1). Compared with WT, PT cyclists showed a greater decay of MMP values under fatigue conditions (P < .001), and these differences increased with accumulating levels of fatigue (decay of -1.8 to -2.9% [WT] with reference to 0 kJ{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 vs -1.1% to -4.4% [PT] after 15 kJ{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 and of -4.7% to -8.8% [WT] vs -7.6% to -11.6% [PT] after 45 kJ{\textperiodcentered}kg-1). No consistent differences were found between WT and PT cyclists in MMP values assessed in nonfatigue conditions (after 0 kJ{\textperiodcentered}kg-1), but WT cyclists attained significantly higher MMP values with accumulating levels of fatigue, particularly for long-duration efforts (≥5 min). Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of considering fatigue when assessing the record power profile of endurance athletes and support the ability to attenuate fatigue-induced decline in MMP values as a determinant of endurance performance.},

abstract = {The aim of this novel study was to analyze the effect of deliberate practice (DP) and easy continuous runs completed by elite-standard and world-class long-distance runners on competitive performances during the first 7 years of their sport careers. Eighty-five male runners reported their best times in different running events and the amounts of different DP activities (tempo runs and short- and long-interval sessions) and 1 non-DP activity (easy runs) after 3, 5, and 7 years of systematic training. Pearson's correlations were calculated between performances (calculated using the International Association of Athletics Federations' scoring tables) and the distances run for the different activities (and overall total). Simple and multiple linear regression analysis calculated how well these activities predicted performance. Pearson's correlations showed consistently large effects on performance of total distance (r $ 0.75, p, 0.001), easy runs (r $ 0.68, p, 0.001), tempo runs (r $ 0.50, p, 0.001), and short-interval training (r $ 0.53, p, 0.001). Long-interval training was not strongly correlated (r $ 0.22). Total distance accounted for significant variance in performance (R2 $ 0.57, p, 0.001). Of the training modes, hierarchical regression analysis showed that easy runs and tempo runs were the activities that accounted for significant variance in performance (p, 0.01). Although DP activities, particularly tempo runs and short-interval training, are important for improving performance, coaches should note that the non-DP activity of easy running was crucial in better performances, partly because of its contribution to total distance run.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to characterize Kenyan runners in regard to their oxygen uptake and blood and ammonia responses when running. Untrained Kenyan boys (14.2±0.2 years) and Scandinavian runners were included for comparison. The studies were performed at altitude (∼2.000 m.a.s.l.) and, for several Kenyan and Scandinavian runners, at sea level as well. At altitude sedentary adolescent Kenyan boys had a mean maximal oxygen uptake (Vo2max) of 47 (44–51) ml {\textperiodcentered} kg−1{\textperiodcentered} min−1, whereas similarly aged boys regularly walking or running but not training for competition reached above 62 (58–71) ml {\textperiodcentered} kg−1{\textperiodcentered} min−1 in Vo2max. Kenyan runners in active training had 68±1.4 ml {\textperiodcentered} kg−1{\textperiodcentered} min−1 at altitude and 79.9±1.4 ml {\textperiodcentered} kg−1{\textperiodcentered} min−1 at sea level, with individuals reaching 85 ml {\textperiodcentered} kg−1{\textperiodcentered} min−1. The best Scandinavian runners were not significantly different from the Kenyan runners in Vo2max both at altitude and at sea level, but none of the Scandinavians reached as high individual values as observed for some Kenyan runners. The running efficiency, determined as the oxygen cost at a given running speed, was less in the Kenyan runners, and the difference became more pronounced when body weight was expressed in ml {\textperiodcentered} kg−0.75 min−1. Blood lactate concentration was in general lower in the Kenyan than in the Scandinavian runners, and the Kenyans also had extremely low ammonia accumulation in the blood even at very high exercise intensities. It is concluded that it is the physical activity during childhood, combined with intense training as teenagers that brings about the high Vo2max observed in some Kenyan runners.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 10 weeks of effort-matched short intervals (SI; n=9) or long intervals (LI; n=7) in cyclists. The high-intensity interval sessions (HIT) were performed twice a week interspersed with low-intensity training. There were no differences between groups at pretest. There were no differences between groups in total volume of both HIT and low-intensity training. The SI group achieved a larger relative improvement in VO2max than the LI group (8.7%±5.0% vs 2.6%±5.2%), respectively, P≤0.05). Mean effect size (ES) of the relative improvement in all measured parameters, including performance measured as mean power output during 30-s all-out, 5-min all-out, and 40-min all-out tests revealed a moderate-to-large effect of SI training vs LI training (ES range was 0.86-1.54). These results suggest that the present SI protocol induces superior training adaptations on both the high-power region and lower power region of cyclists' power profile compared with the present LI protocol.},

abstract = {Context: Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is often ingested at a dose of 0.3 g/kg body mass (BM), but ingestion protocols are inconsistent in terms of using solution or capsules, ingestion period, combining NaHCO3 with sodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7), and coingested food and fluid. Purpose: To quantify the effect of ingesting 0.3 g/kg NaHCO3 on blood pH, [HCO3-], and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms over the subsequent 3 hr using a range of ingestion protocols and, thus, to determine an optimal protocol. Methods: In a crossover design, 13 physically active subjects undertook 8 NaHCO3 experimental ingestion protocols and 1 placebo protocol. Capillary blood was taken every 30 min and analyzed for pH and [HCO3-]. GI symptoms were quantified every 30 min via questionnaire. Statistics used were pairwise comparisons between protocols; differences were interpreted in relation to smallest worthwhile changes for each variable. A likelihood of >75% was a substantial change. Results: [HCO3-] and pH were substantially greater than in placebo for all other ingestion protocols at almost all time points. When NaHCO3 was coingested with food, the greatest [HCO3-] (30.9 mmol/kg) and pH (7.49) and lowest incidence of GI symptoms were observed. The greatest incidence of GI side effects was observed 90 min after ingestion of 0.3 g/kg NaHCO3 solution. Conclusions: The changes in pH and [HCO3-] for the 8 NaHCO3-ingestion protocols were similar, so an optimal protocol cannot be recommended. However, the results suggest that NaHCO3 coingested with a high-carbohydrate meal should be taken 120-150 min before exercise to induce substantial blood alkalosis and reduce GI symptoms. {\textcopyright} 2011 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

abstract = {Blood doping practices in sports have been around for at least half a century and will likely remain for several years to come. The main reason for the various forms of blood doping to be common is that they are easy to perform, and the effects on exercise performance are gigantic. Yet another reason for blood doping to be a popular illicit practice is that detection is difficult. For autologous blood transfusions, for example, no direct test exists, and the direct testing of misuse with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) has proven very difficult despite a test exists. Future blood doping practice will likely include the stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor which leads to an increased endogenous erythropoietin synthesis. It seems unrealistic to develop specific test against such drugs (and the copies hereof originating from illegal laboratories). In an attempt to detect and limit blood doping, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has launched the Athlete Biological Passport where indirect markers for all types of blood doping are evaluated on an individual level. The approach seemed promising, but a recent publication demonstrates the system to be incapable of detecting even a single subject as 'suspicious' while treated with rhEpo for 10-12 weeks. Sad to say, the hope that the 2012 London Olympics should be cleaner in regard to blood doping seems faint. We propose that WADA strengthens the quality and capacities of the National Anti-Doping Agencies and that they work more efficiently with the international sports federations in an attempt to limit blood doping. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.},

abstract = {Purpose This study compared the physiological effects of a moderate-intensity interval training (MIT) microcycle followed by an active recovery period (collectively termed MITblock) with a time-matched regular training period (REG) during the general preparation phase in well-trained cyclists. Methods Using a randomized crossover design, 30 well-trained male cyclists (maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), 70.5 (4.6) mL{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) completed both MITblock and REG. The MIT microcycle involved six interval sessions over seven days with 5-7 × 10-14 min work intervals at a perceived exertion (RPE) of 14-15 on the Borg 6-20 scale. A six-day active recovery period followed before physiological testing. During REG, cyclists performed their regular preparatory-phase training routine, which primarily involved low-intensity exercise. Specific guidelines included completing either two MIT sessions or one MIT session and one high-intensity interval session per week. Endurance performance indicators assessed included changes in 15 min maximal average power output (PO15min), power output at 4 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L-1 [blood lactate] (PO4mmol), 1 min peak power output during incremental testing (POVO2max), and VO2max. Results Although the Training Impulse (TRIMP) score was not different between MITblock and REG (1944 (436) vs. 1800 (232), respectively; p = 0.27), MITblock resulted in significantly greater improvements than REG in PO4mmol (4.0 (4.4)% vs. -1.3 (3.7)%, p < 0.01), POVO2max (2.5 (4.5)% vs. -0.7 (3.9)%, p < 0.01) and VO2max (2.0 (3.9)% vs. 0.0 (3.5)%, p = 0.05). Changes in PO15min were not statistically different between MITblock and REG (3.9 (8.3)% vs. 0.2 (6.8)%, p = 0.14). During MIT intervals, RPE was 14.4 (0.3), corresponding to 66 (5)% of POVO2max, 85 (3)% of maximal heart rate, and 2.8 (1.1) mmol{\textperiodcentered}L-1 [blood lactate]. Conclusions Six moderate-intensity interval sessions over seven days, followed by a six-day active recovery period, induce improvements in endurance performance indicators compared to a time-matched regular training period in well-trained cyclists.

abstract = {Across a wide range of species and body mass a close matching exists between maximal conductive oxygen delivery and mitochondrial respiratory rate. In this study we investigated in humans how closely in-vivo maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) is matched to state 3 muscle mitochondrial respiration. High resolution respirometry was used to quantify mitochondrial respiration from the biopsies of arm and leg muscles while in-vivo arm and leg VO2 were determined by the Fick method during leg cycling and arm cranking. We hypothesized that muscle mitochondrial respiratory rate exceeds that of systemic oxygen delivery. The state 3 mitochondrial respiration of the deltoid muscle (4.3±0.4mmolo2kg-1min-1) was similar to the in-vivo VO2 during maximal arm cranking (4.7±0.5mmolO2kg-1min-1) with 6kg muscle. In contrast, the mitochondrial state 3 of the quadriceps was 6.9±0.5mmolO2kg-1min-1, exceeding the in-vivo leg VO2 max (5.0±0.2mmolO2kg-1min-1) during leg cycling with 20kg muscle (P<0.05). Thus, when half or more of the body muscle mass is engaged during exercise, muscle mitochondrial respiratory capacity surpasses in-vivo VO2 max. The findings reveal an excess capacity of muscle mitochondrial respiratory rate over O2 delivery by the circulation in the cascade defining maximal oxidative rate in humans. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.},

abstract = {The Athlete Blood Passport is the most recent tool adopted by anti-doping authorities to detect athletes using performance-enhancing drugs such as recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO). This strategy relies on detecting abnormal variations in haematological variables caused by doping, against a background of biological and analytical variability. Ten subjects were given twice weekly intravenous injections of rhEPO for up to 12 weeks. Full blood counts were measured using a Sysmex XE-2100 automated haematology analyser, and total haemoglobin mass via a carbon monoxide rebreathing test. The sensitivity of the passport to flag abnormal deviations in blood values was evaluated using dedicated Athlete Blood Passport software. Our treatment regimen elicited a 10% increase in total haemoglobin mass equivalent to approximately two bags of reinfused blood. The passport software did not flag any subjects as being suspicious of doping whilst they were receiving rhEPO. We conclude that it is possible for athletes to use rhEPO without eliciting abnormal changes in the blood variables currently monitored by the Athlete Blood Passport. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2011.},

abstract = {The measurement of fat balance (fat input minus fat output) involves the accurate estimation of both metabolizable fat intake and total fat oxidation. This is possible mostly under laboratory conditions and not yet in free-living conditions. In the latter situation, net fat retention/mobilization can be estimated based on precise and accurate sequential body composition measurements. In case of positive balance, lipids stored in adipose tissue can originate from dietary (exogenous) lipids or from nonlipid precursors, mainly from carbohydrates (CHOs) but also from ethanol, through a process known as de novo lipogenesis (DNL). Basic equations are provided in this review to facilitate the interpretation of the different subcomponents of fat balance (endogenous vs exogenous) under different nutritional circumstances. One difficulty is methodological: total DNL is difficult to measure quantitatively in man; for example, indirect calorimetry only tracks net DNL, not total DNL. Although the numerous factors (mostly exogenous) influencing DNL have been studied, in particular the effect of CHO overfeeding, there is little information on the rate of DNL in habitual conditions of life, that is, large day-to-day fluctuations of CHO intakes, different types of CHO ingested with different glycemic indexes, alcohol combined with excess CHO intakes, etc. Three issues, which are still controversial today, will be addressed: (1) Is the increase of fat mass induced by CHO overfeeding explained by DNL only, or by decreased endogenous fat oxidation, or both? (2) Is DNL different in overweight and obese individuals as compared to their lean counterparts? (3) Does DNL occur both in the liver and in adipose tissue? Recent studies have demonstrated that acute CHO overfeeding influences adipose tissue lipogenic gene expression and that CHO may stimulate DNL in skeletal muscles, at least in vitro. The role of DNL and its importance in health and disease remain to be further clarified, in particular the putative effect of DNL on the control of energy intake and energy expenditure, as well as the occurrence of DNL in other tissues (such as in myocytes) in addition to hepatocytes and adipocytes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Here we report on the effect of combining endurance training with heavy or explosive strength training on endurance performance in endurance-trained runners and cyclists. Running economy is improved by performing combined endurance training with either heavy or explosive strength training. However, heavy strength training is recommended for improving cycling economy. Equivocal findings exist regarding the effects on power output or velocity at the lactate threshold. Concurrent endurance and heavy strength training can increase running speed and power output at VO2max (Vmax and Wmax, respectively) or time to exhaustion at Vmax and Wmax. Combining endurance training with either explosive or heavy strength training can improve running performance, while there is most compelling evidence of an additive effect on cycling performance when heavy strength training is used. It is suggested that the improved endurance performance may relate to delayed activation of less efficient type II fibers, improved neuromuscular efficiency, conversion of fast-twitch type IIX fibers into more fatigue-resistant type IIA fibers, or improved musculo-tendinous stiffness. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

abstract = {Purpose: Training near V˙ O2max is considered to be the most effective way to enhance V˙ O2max. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a well-known time-efficient training method for improving cardiorespiratory and metabolic function and V˙ O2max. While long HIIT bouts allow V˙ O2max to be achieved quickly, short HIIT bouts improve time to exhaustion (Tlim). The aim of this study was to evaluate the time spent above 90% V˙ O2peak (T > 90% V˙ O2peak) during three different HIIT protocols. Methods: Twelve cyclists performed three HIIT sessions. Each protocol had the same work and recovery power and ratio of work{\textperiodcentered}recovery−1. The protocols consisted of long-interval HIIT (LIHIIT, 3 min work—2 min recovery), short-interval HIIT (SIHIIT, 30 s work—20 s recovery), and high-intensity decreasing interval training (HIDIT, work from 3 min to 30 s and recovery from 2 min to 20 s). T > 90% V˙ O2peak, Tlim, blood lactate [La], and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured at Tlim. Results: T > 90% V˙ O2peak was greater in HIDIT (312 ± 207 s) than in SIHIIT (182 ± 225 s; P = 0.036) or LIHIIT (179 ± 145 s; P = 0.027). Tlim was not significantly different (P > 0.05) between HIDIT (798 ± 185 s), SIHIIT (714 ± 265 s), and LIHIIT (664 ± 282). At Tlim, no differences in [La] and RPE were found between protocols (P > 0.05). Conclusion: HIDIT showed the highest T > 90% V˙ O2peak, suggesting that it may be a good strategy to increase time close to V˙ O2peak, despite similar Tlim, [La], and RPE at Tlim.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of including 30-s sprints in one weekly low-intensity training (LIT) session during a 3-week transition period in elite cyclists. Sixteen male elite cyclists (maximal oxygen uptake, VO2max: 72 ± 5 ml{\textperiodcentered}kg−1{\textperiodcentered}min−1) reduced their training load by $\sim$60% for 3 weeks from the end of competitive season and performed only LIT or included 30-s sprints (SPR) in one weekly LIT-session. Performance and physiological capacities were evaluated during a prolonged ($\sim$2.5 h) test-session, including a strength test, a submaximal blood lactate profile test, an incremental test to exhaustion to determine VO2max, 1 h continuous cycling including four maximal 30-s sprints, and a 20-min all-out test. In addition, mental recovery was evaluated using the Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ARQ). The only significant between-group change during the transition period was an 8 ± 11% larger improvement in 30-s sprint performance in SPR compared to control (CON; SPR: 4 ± 5%, CON: −4 ± 5%, p = 0.01). Although not different from CON, SPR maintained 20-min all-out performance (−1 ± 5%, p = 0.37) and fractional utilization of VO2max (1.9 ± 6.1%-points, p = 0.18) during the 20-min all-out test, whereas corresponding declines were observed in CON (−3 ± 5%, p = 0.04, and −2.5 ± 2.9%-points, p = 0.02, respectively). Power output at 4 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L−1 blood lactate concentration decreased similarly in SPR (−4 ± 4%, p = 0.02) and CON (−5 ± 5%, p = 0.01), while VO2max, maximal aerobic power (Wmax), and total burnout score were unaffected in both groups. Including sprints in one weekly LIT-session in the transition period improves sprint performance and maintains 20-min all-out power and fractional utilization of VO2max without compromising mental recovery. Inclusion of sprints in LIT-sessions may therefore be a plausible, time-efficient strategy during short periods of reduced training.},

Part 2 focuses on the factors that affect cycling performance. Among those factors, aerodynamic resistance is the major resistance force the racing cyclist must overcome. This challenge can be dealt with through equipment technological modifications and body position configuration adjustments. To successfully achieve efficient transfer of power from the body to the drive train of the bicycle the major concern is bicycle configuration and cycling body position. Peak power output appears to be highly correlated with cycling success. Likewise, gear ratio and pedalling cadence directly influence cycling economy/efficiency. Knowledge of muscle recruitment throughout the crank cycle has important implications for training and body position adjustments while climbing. A review of pacing models suggests that while there appears to be some evidence in favour of one technique over another, there remains the need for further field research to validate the findings. Nevertheless, performance modelling has important implications for the establishment of performance standards and consequent recommendations for training.},

METHODS: Training data of 5 male track endurance cyclists (mean [SD]; age 23.4 [3.46] y; body mass 80.2 [2.74] kg; 4.5 [0.17] W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 at LT2; maximal aerobic power 6.2 [0.27] W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1; maximal oxygen uptake 65.9 [2.89] mL{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1) were analyzed with weekly total training volume by training type and heart rate, power output, and torque intensity distributions calculated with reference to the respective WRs' performance requirements. RESULTS: Athletes completed 805 (82.81) and 725 (68.40) min{\textperiodcentered}wk-1 of training, respectively, in each season. In the second season, there was a 32% increase in total track volume, although track sessions were shorter (ie, greater frequency) in the second season. A pyramidal intensity distribution was consistent across both seasons, with 81% of training, on average, performed below LT1 power output each week, whereas 6% of training was performed above LT2. Athletes accumulated greater volume above WR team pursuit lead power (2.4% vs 0.9%) and torque (6.2% vs 3.2%) in 2019. In one athlete, mean single-leg-press peak rate of force development was 71% and 46% higher at mid- and late-phases, respectively, during the preparation period. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide novel insights into the common and contrasting methods contributing to successive WR team pursuit performances. Greater accumulation of volume above race-specific power and torque (eg, team pursuit lead), as well as improved neuromuscular force-generating capacities, may be worthy of investigation for implementation in training programs.},

abstract = {The metabolic response to exercise at high altitude is different from that at sea level, depending on the altitude, the rate of ascent and duration of acclimatization. One apparent metabolic difference that was described in the 1930s is the phenomenon referred to as the 'lactate paradox'. Acute exposure to hypoxia results in higher blood lactate accumulation at submaximal workloads compared with sea level, but peak blood lactate remain the same. Following continued exposure to hypoxia or altitude, blood lactate accumulation at submaximal work and peak blood lactate levels are paradoxically reduced compared with those at sea level. It has recently been shown, however, that, if the exposure to altitude is sufficiently long, blood lactate responses return to those seen at sea level or during acute hypoxia. Thus, to evaluate the 'lactate paradox' phenomenon in relation to time spent at altitude, five Danish lowland climbers were studied at sea level, during acute exposure to hypoxia (10% 02 in N2) and 1, 4 and 6 weeks after arrival in the basecamp of Mt Everest (∼5400 m, Nepal). Basecamp was reached after 10 days of gradual ascent from 2800 m. Peak blood lactate levels were similar at sea level (11.0 ± 0.7 mmol L-1) and during acute hypoxia (9.9 ± 0.3 mmol L-1), but fell significantly after 1 week of acclimatization to 5400 m (5.6 ± 0.5 mmol L-1) as predicted by the 'lactate paradox'. After 4 weeks of acclimatization, peak lactate accumulation (7.8 ± 1.0 mmol L-1) was still lower compared with acute hypoxia but higher than that seen after 1 week of acclimatization. After 6 weeks of acclimatization, 2 days after return to basecamp after reaching the summit or south summit of Mt Everest, peak lactate levels (10.4 ± 1.1 mmol L-1) were similar to those seen during acute hypoxia. Therefore, these results suggest that the 'lactate paradox' is a transient metabolic phenomenon that is reversed during a prolonged period of exposure to severe hypoxia of more than 6 weeks.},

abstract = {Heat acclimation (HA) involves physiological adaptations that directly promote exercise performance in hot environments. However, for endurance-athletes it is unclear if adaptations also improve aerobic capacity and performance in cool conditions, partly because previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies have been restricted to short intervention periods. Prolonged HA was therefore deployed in the present RCT study including 21 cyclists [38 ± 2 years, 184 ± 1 cm, 80.4 ± 1.7 kg, and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) of 58.1 ± 1.2 mL/min/kg; mean ± SE] allocated to either 5½ weeks of training in the heat [HEAT (n = 12)] or cool control [CON (n = 9)]. Training registration, familiarization to test procedures, determination of VO2max, blood volume and 15 km time trial (TT) performance were assessed in cool conditions (14°C) during a 2-week lead-in period, as well as immediately pre and post the intervention. Participants were instructed to maintain total training volume and complete habitual high intensity intervals in normal settings; but HEAT substituted part of cool training with 28 ± 2 sessions in the heat (1 h at 60% VO2max in 40°C; eliciting core temperatures above 39°C in all sessions), while CON completed all training in cool conditions. Acclimation for HEAT was verified by lower sweat sodium [Na+], reduced steady-state heart rate and improved submaximal exercise endurance in the heat. However, when tested in cool conditions both peak power output and VO2max remained unchanged for HEAT (pre 60.0 ± 1.5 vs. 59.8 ± 1.3 mL O2/min/kg). TT performance tested in 14°C was improved for HEAT and average power output increased from 298 ± 6 to 315 ± 6 W (P < 0.05), but a similar improvement was observed for CON (from 294 ± 11 to 311 ± 10 W). Based on the present findings, we conclude that training in the heat was not superior compared to normal (control) training for improving aerobic power or TT performance in cool conditions.},

abstract = {The purpose was to investigate the effect of 25weeks heavy strength training in young elite cyclists. Nine cyclists performed endurance training and heavy strength training (ES) while seven cyclists performed endurance training only (E). ES, but not E, resulted in increases in isometric half squat performance, lean lower body mass, peak power output during Wingate test, peak aerobic power output (Wmax), power output at 4mmolL-1 [la-], mean power output during 40-min all-out trial, and earlier occurrence of peak torque during the pedal stroke (P<0.05). ES achieved superior improvements in Wmax and mean power output during 40-min all-out trial compared with E (P<0.05). The improvement in 40-min all-out performance was associated with the change toward achieving peak torque earlier in the pedal stroke (r=0.66, P<0.01). Neither of the groups displayed alterations in VO2max or cycling economy. In conclusion, heavy strength training leads to improved cycling performance in elite cyclists as evidenced by a superior effect size of ES training vs E training on relative improvements in power output at 4mmolL-1 [la-], peak power output during 30-s Wingate test, Wmax, and mean power output during 40-min all-out trial.},

abstract = {Purpose The objective of this study is to compare the physiological capacity and training characteristics of the world's six highest ranked female cross-country skiers (world class (WC)) with those of six competitors of national class (NC). Methods Immediately before the start of the competition season, all skiers performed three 5-min submaximal stages of roller skiing on a treadmill for measurement of oxygen cost, as well as a 3-min self-paced performance test using both the double poling (DP) and diagonal stride (DIA) techniques. During the 3-min performance tests, the total distance covered, peak oxygen uptake (V-O 2peak), and accumulated oxygen deficit were determined. Each skier documented the intensity and mode of their training during the preceding 6 months in a diary. Results There were no differences between the groups with respect to oxygen cost or gross efficiency at the submaximal speeds. The WC skiers covered 6%-7% longer distances during the 3-min tests and exhibited average V-O 2peak values of ∼70 and ∼65 mL{\textperiodcentered}min -1 {\textperiodcentered}kg -1 with DIA and DP, respectively, which were 10% and 7% higher than the NC skiers (all P < 0.05). However, the accumulated oxygen deficit did not differ between groups. From May to October, the WC skiers trained a total of 532 ± 73 h (270 ± 26 sessions) versus 411 ± 62 h (240 ± 27 sessions) for the NC skiers. In addition, the WC skiers performed 26% more low-intensity and almost twice as much moderate-intensity endurance and speed training (all P < 0.05). Conclusions This study highlights the importance of a high oxygen uptake and the ability to use this while performing the different skiing techniques on varying terrains for female cross-country skiers to win international races. In addition, the training data documented here provide benchmark values for female endurance athletes aiming for medals.},

abstract = {Background: A new commercially available sodium bicarbonate (SB) supplement claims to limit gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort and increase extracellular buffering capacity. To date, no available data exists to substantiate such claims. Therefore, the aim of this study was to measure blood acid–base balance and GI discomfort responses following the ingestion of SB using the novel “Bicarb System” (M-SB). Twelve well-trained male cyclists completed this randomised crossover designed study. Maximal oxygen consumption was determined in visit one, whilst during visits two and three participants ingested 0.3 g∙kg−1 BM SB using M-SB (Maurten, Sweden) or vegetarian capsules (C-SB) in a randomised order. Finger prick capillary blood samples were measured every 30 min for pH, bicarbonate (HCO3−), and electrolytes (potassium, chloride, calcium, and sodium), for 300 min. Visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to assess GI symptoms using the same time intervals. Results: Peak HCO3− was 0.95 mmol∙L−1 greater following M-SB (p = 0.023, g = 0.61), with time to peak HCO3− achieved 38.2 min earlier (117 ± 37 vs. 156 ± 36 min; p = 0.026, r = 0.67) and remained elevated for longer (p = 0.043, g = 0.51). No differences were observed for any electrolytes between the conditions. Aggregated GI discomfort was reduced by 79 AU following M-SB (p < 0.001, g = 1.11), with M-SB reducing stomach cramps, bowel urgency, diarrhoea, belching, and stomach-ache compared to C-SB. Conclusions: This is the first study to report that M-SB can increase buffering capacity and reduce GI discomfort. This presents a major potential benefit for athletes considering SB as an ergogenic supplement as GI discomfort is almost eliminated. Future research should determine if M-SB is performance enhancing.},

abstract = {Anaerobic energy release is of great importance for shortlasting exercise but has  been difficult to quantify. In order to determine the amount of anaerobic energy release during shortlasting exercise we let 17 healthy young males exercise on the ergometer bike to exhaustion. The power during exercise was kept constant and selected to cause exhaustion in approximately 30 s, 1 min, or 2-3 min. The O2 uptake was measured continuously during the exercise, and the anaerobic energy release was quantified by the accumulated O2 deficit. The work done as well as the total energy release rose linearly with the exercise duration and was therefore a sum of a component proportional to time plus a constant addition. The accumulated O2 deficit increased from 1.86 +/- 0.07 (SE) mmol/kg for 30 s exercise to 2.25 +/- 0.06 mmol/kg for 1 min exercise and further to 2.42 +/- 0.08 mmol/kg for exercise lasting 2 min or more (P less than 0.01). The accumulated O2 uptake increased linearly with the duration, and as a consequence of this the relative importance of aerobic processes increased from 40% at 30 s duration to 50% at 1 min duration and further to 65% for exercise lasting 2 min. These results show that both aerobic and anaerobic processes contribute significantly during intense exercise lasting from 30 s to 3 min.},

Herein, we sought to systematically review and determine the effects of ET on VO2max, Qmax, and a-VO2diff at maximal exercise, and on their associations, in healthy young subjects. Methods We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science (from their inception until September 2014) for articles assessing the effects of ET lasting ≥3 wk on VO2max and Qmax and/or a-VO2diff at maximal exercise in healthy young adults (mean age <40 yr). Meta-analyses were performed to determine standardized mean differences (SMD) in VO2max, Qmax, and a-VO2diff at maximal exercise between posttraining and pretraining measurements. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were used to evaluate associations among SMD and potential moderating factors. Results Thirteen studies were included after systematic review, comprising a total of 130 untrained or moderately trained healthy young subjects (mean age, 22-28 yr). Duration of ET programs ranged from 5 to 12.9 wk. After data pooling, VO2max (SMD = 0.75, P < 0.0001) and Qmax (SMD = 0.64, P < 0.0001), but not a-VO2diff at maximal exercise (SMD = 0.21, P = 0.23), were increased after ET. No significant heterogeneity was detected. With meta-regression, the SMD in Qmax was positively associated with the SMD in VO2max (B = 0.91, P = 0.007). The SMD in a-VO2diff at maximal exercise was not associated with the SMD in VO2max (B = 0.20, P = 0.40). Conclusions Based on a relatively small number of studies, improvement in VO2max following 5-13 wk of ET is associated with increase in Qmax, but not in a-VO2diff, in previously untrained to moderately trained healthy young individuals.},

abstract = {Purpose: To determine the impact of interval training frequency in elite endurance athletes. It was hypothesized that two longer sessions would elicit greater performance improvements and physiological adaptation than four shorter sessions at the same intensity. Methods: Elite cross-country skiers and biathletes were randomly assigned to either a high-frequency group (HF group) (5 M, 1 F, age 22 (19–26), VO2max 67.8 (65.5–70.2) mL/kg/min) doing four short interval sessions per week or a low-frequency group (LF group) (8 M, 1 F, age 22 (18–23), VO2max 70.7 (67.0–73.9) mL/kg/min) doing two longer interval sessions. All interval sessions were performed at $\sim$85% of maximum heart rate, and groups were matched for total weekly training volume. Pre-and post-intervention, athletes completed an 8 km rollerski time-trial, maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) test, and an incremental, submaximal exercise test. Results: The LF group had a statistically significant improved time-trial performance following the intervention (p = 0.04), with no statistically significant changes in the HF group. Similarly, percentage utilization of VO2max at anaerobic threshold (p = 0.04) and exercise economy (p = 0.01) were statistically significantly improved following the intervention in the LF group only. No statistically significant changes in VO2max were observed in either group. Conclusions: Two longer interval sessions appear superior to four shorter sessions per week in promoting endurance adaptations and performance improvements in elite endurance athletes. Despite matched training volume and exercise intensity, the larger, more concentrated exercise stimulus in the LF group appears to induce more favorable adaptations. The longer time between training sessions in the LF group may also have allowed athletes to recover more effectively and better “absorb” the training. These findings are in line with the “best practice” observed by many of the world's best endurance athletes.},

METHODS: Training data of 5 male track endurance cyclists (mean [SD]; age 21.9 [3.52] y; 4.4 [0.16] W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 at anaerobic threshold; 6.2 [0.28] W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 maximal oxygen uptake 68.7 [2.99] mL kg{\textperiodcentered}min-1) were analyzed with weekly total training volume and heart rate, power output, and torque intensity distributions calculated with reference to their 3:49.804 min:s.ms performance requirements for a 4-km team pursuit. RESULTS: Athletes completed 543 (37) h-1 of training across 436 (16) sessions. On-bike activities accounted for 69.9% of all training sessions, with participants cycling 11,246 (1139) km-1 in the training period of interest, whereas 12.7% of sessions involved gym/strength training. A pyramidal intensity distribution was evident with over 65% and 70% of training, respectively, performed at low-intensity zone heart rate and power output, whereas 5.3% and 7.7% of training was performed above anaerobic threshold. The athletes accumulated 4.4% of total training volume at, or above, their world-record team pursuit lead position torque (55 N{\textperiodcentered}m). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide updated and novel insight to the power and torque demands and load accumulation contributing to world-record team pursuit performance. Although the observed pyramidal intensity distribution is common in endurance sports, the lack of shift toward a polarized intensity distribution during taper and competition peaking differs from previous research.},

abstract = {Purpose: A mathematical model to describe the interplay of distinct metabolic rates during exercise was developed decades ago. Despite its use in endurance performance diagnostics, attempts to validate the model's assumptions and predictions on experimental data are rare. We here provide a comprehensive study of the latter focusing on the steady state. Methods: We rewrote the mathematical equations in the steady state and tested them on a data set of N = 160 individuals derived from five studies in cycling and running. Results: The rewritten equations reveal a unique relationship between the ratio of the maximum oxygen uptake and the lactate accumulation rate, and the fractional utilization of oxygen uptake at the maximum lactate steady-state. Experimental data for running and cycling do not provide evidence that this relation holds. Conclusion: Given the current protocols to measure the maximum lactate accumulation rate, the model predictions cannot be considered as quantitative. Its use in individualized performance diagnostics is thus scientifically questionable. Additional model layers and/or more precise methods of measurement may improve the agreement between the model predictions and the data, but require experimental validation.},

abstract = {We prove that, given an average power, the ascent time is minimized if a cyclist maintains a constant ground speed regardless of the slope. Herein, minimizing the time is equivalent to maximizing -- for a given uphill -- the corresponding mean ascent velocity (VAM: velocit\`a ascensionale media), which is a common training metric. We illustrate the proof with numerical examples, and show that, in general, maintaining a constant instantaneous power results in longer ascent times; both strategies result in the same time if the slope is constant. Given standard available information -- including level of fitness, quantified by the power output, and ascent profile -- our results allow for reliable and convenient strategies of uphill timetrials.},

abstract = {Theoretical best performance times (ttheor) in track running are calculated as follows. Maximal metabolic power (Emax) is a known function of maximal oxygen uptake (♀O2max), of maximal anaerobic capacity (AnS) and of effort duration to exhaustion (te): Emax=f (te). Metabolic power requirement (Er) to cover the distance (d) in the performance time tp is the product of the energy cost of locomotion per unit distance (C) and the speed: Er=Cxd/tp. The time values for which Emax (te) = Er (tp), assumed to yield ttheor can be obtained for any given subject and distance provided that VO2max, AnS and C are known, and compared with actual best performances (tact). For 15 min≥te≥100 s, the overall ratio tact/ttheor was rather close to 1.0. To estimate the relative role of the different factors limiting VO2max, several resistances to O2 transport are identified, inversely proportional to: alveolar ventilation (Rv*), O2 transport by the circulation (RQ), O2 diffusion from capillary blood to mitochondria (Rt), mitochondrial capacity (Rm). Observed changes Of ̇VO2max are accompanied by measured changes of several resistances. The ratio of each resistance to the overall resistance can therefore be calculated by means of the O2 conductance equation. In exercise with large muscle groups (two legs), RQ is the major (75%) limiting factor downstream of the lung, its role being reduced to 50% during exercise with small muscle groups (one leg). Rt and Rm account for the remaining fractions. In normoxia Rv* is negligible; at high altitude it increases progressively, together with Rt and Rm, at the expense of RQ.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to ascertain the optimal test duration to elicit the highest maximal lactate formation rate (V˙Lamax), whilst exploring the underpinning energetics, and identifying the optimal blood lactate sampling period. Methods: Fifteen trained to well-trained males (age 27 ± 6 years; peak power: 1134 ± 174 W) participated in a randomised cross-over design completing three all-out sprint cycling tests of differing test durations (10, 15, and 30 s). Peak and mean power output (W and W.kg−1), oxygen uptake, and blood lactate concentrations were measured. V˙Lamax and energetic contributions (phosphagen, glycolytic, and oxidative) were determined using these parameters. Results: The shortest test duration of 10 s elicited a significantly (p = 0.003; p < 0.001) higher V˙Lamax (0.86 ± 0.17 mmol.L−1.s−1; 95% CI 0.802–0.974) compared with both 15 s (0.68 ± 0.18 mmol.L−1.s−1; 95% CI 0.596–0.794) and 30 s (0.45 ± 0.07 mmol.L−1.s−1; 95% CI 0.410–0.487). Differences in V˙Lamax were associated with large effect sizes (d = 1.07, d = 3.15). We observed 81% of the PCr and 53% of the glycolytic work completed over the 30 s sprint duration was attained after 10 s. BLamaxpost were achieved at 5 ± 2 min (ttest 10 s), 6 ± 2 min (ttest 15 s), and 7 ± 2 min (ttest 30 s), respectively. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated a 10 s test duration elicited the highest V˙Lamax. Furthermore, the 10 s test duration mitigated the influence of the oxidative metabolism during all-out cycling. The optimal sample time to determine peak blood lactate concentration following 10 s was 5 ± 2 min.},

abstract = {Objectives: Currently, there are no data on sex differences in the power profiles in sprint track cycling. This cross-section study analyses retrospective data of female and male track sprint cyclists for sex differences. We hypothesized that women would exhibit lower peak power to weight than men, as well as demonstrate a different distribution of power durations related to sprint cycling performance. Design: We used training, testing, and racing data from a publicly available online depository (www.strava.com), for 29 track sprint cyclists (eight women providing 18 datasets, and 21 men providing 54 datasets) to create sex-specific profiles. R2 was used to describe model quality, and regression indices are used to compare watts per kilogram (W/kg) for each duration for both sexes against a 1:1 relationship expected for 15-s:15-s W/kg. Results: We confirmed our sample were sprint cyclists, displaying higher peak and competition power than track endurance cyclists. All power profiles showed a high model quality (R2 ≥ 0.77). Regression indices for both sexes were similar for all durations, suggesting similar peak power and similar relationship between peak power and endurance level for both men and women (rejecting our hypothesis). The value of R2 for the female sprinters showed greater variation suggesting greater differences within female sprint cyclists. Conclusion: The main finding shows female sprint cyclists in this study have very similar relationships between peak power and endurance power as men. Higher variation in W/kg for women in this study than men, within these strong relationships, indicates women in this study, had greater inter-athlete variability, and may thus require more personalised training. Future work needs to be performed with larger samples, and at different levels to optimize these recommendations.},

abstract = {In short-term studies, block periodization of high-intensity training (HIT) has been shown to be an effective strategy that enhances performance and related physiological factors. However, long-term studies and detailed investigations of macro, meso, and micro-periodization of HIT blocks in world-class endurance athletes are currently lacking. In a recent study, we showed that the world's most successful cross-country (XC) skier used two different periodization models with success throughout her career. One including extensive use of HIT blocks, namely BP, and one using a traditional method namely TRAD. In this study, we compare BP with TRAD in two comparable successful seasons and provide a detailed description of the annual use of HIT blocks in BP. The participant is the most-decorated winter Olympian, with 8 Olympic gold medals, 18 world championship titles, and 114 world cup victories. Training data was categorized by training form (endurance, strength, and speed), intensity [low (LIT), moderate (MIT), and HIT], and mode (running, cycling, and skiing/roller skiing). No significant difference was found in the total endurance training load between BP and TRAD. However, training volume in BP was lower compared to TRAD (15 ± 6 vs. 18 ± 7 h/wk, P = 0.001), mainly explained by less LIT (13 ± 5 vs. 15 ± 5 h/wk, P = 0.004). Lower volume of MIT was also performed in BP compared to TRAD (13 vs. 38 sessions/year), whereas the amount of HIT was higher in BP (157 vs. 77 sessions/year). While BP included high amounts of HIT already from the first preparation period, followed by a reduction toward the competition period, TRAD had a progressive increase in HIT toward the competition period. In BP, the athlete performed seven HIT blocks, varying from 7 to 11 days, each including 8-13 HIT sessions. This study provides novel insights into successful utilization of two different periodization models in the worlds best XC skier, and illustrates the macro, meso and micro- periodization of HIT blocks to increase the overall amount of HIT.},

abstract = {Aim: To review current cycling-related sport-science literature to formulate guidelines to classify female subject groups and to compare this classification system for female subject groups with the classification system for male subject groups. Methods: A database of 82 papers that described female subject groups containing information on preexperimental maximal cycle-protocol designs, terminology, biometrical and physiological parameters, and cycling experience was analyzed. Subject groups were divided into performance levels (PLs), according to the nomenclature. Body mass, body-mass index, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), peak power output (PPO), and training status were compared between PLs and between female and male PLs. Results: Five female PLs were defined, representing untrained, active, trained, well-trained, and professional female subjects. VO2max and PPO significantly increased with PL, except for PL3 and PL4 (P < .01). For each PL, significant differences were observed in absolute and relative VO2max and PPO between male and female subject groups. Relative VO2max is the most cited parameter for female subject groups and is proposed as the principal parameter to classify the groups. Conclusion: This systematic review shows the large variety in the description of female subject groups in the existing literature. The authors propose a standardized preexperimental testing protocol and guidelines to classify female subject groups into 5 PLs based on relative VO2max, relative PPO, training status, absolute VO2max, and absolute PPO.},

abstract = {To examine the ability of a multivariate model to predict maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) using performance data from a 5-minute maximal test (5MT). Methods: Forty-six road cyclists (age 38 [9] y, height 177 [9] cm, weight 71.4 [8.6] kg, VO2max 61.13 [9.05] mL/kg/min) completed a graded exercise test to assess VO2max and power output. After a 72-hour rest, they performed a test that included a 5-minute maximal bout. Performance variables in each test were modeled in 2 independent equations, using Bayesian general linear regressions to predict VO2max. Stepwise selection was then used to identify theminimal subset of parameters with the best predictive power for each model. Results: Five-minute relative power output was the best explanatory variable to predict VO2max in the model from the graded exercise test (R2 95% credibility interval, .81-.88) and when using data from the 5MT (R2 95% credibility interval, .61-.77). Accordingly, VO2max could be predicted with a 5MT using the equation VO2max = 16.6 + (8.87 × 5-min relative power output). Conclusions: Road cycling VO2max can be predicted in cyclists through a single-variable equation that includes relative power obtained during a 5MT. Coaches, cyclists, and scientists may benefit from the reduction of laboratory assessments performed on athletes due to this finding.},

@article{Buchheit2013,
abstract = {High-intensity interval training (HIT) is a well-known, time-efficient training method for improving cardiorespiratory and metabolic function and, in turn, physical performance in athletes. HIT involves repeated short (<45 s) to long (2-4 min) bouts of rather high-intensity exercise interspersed with recovery periods (refer to the previously published first part of this review). While athletes have used 'classical' HIT formats for nearly a century (e.g. repetitions of 30 s of exercise interspersed with 30 s of rest, or 2-4-min interval repetitions ran at high but still submaximal intensities), there is today a surge of research interest focused on examining the effects of short sprints and all-out efforts, both in the field and in the laboratory. Prescription of HIT consists of the manipulation of at least nine variables (e.g. work interval intensity and duration, relief interval intensity and duration, exercise modality, number of repetitions, number of series, between-series recovery duration and intensity); any of which has a likely effect on the acute physiological response. Manipulating HIT appropriately is important, not only with respect to the expected middle- to long-term physiological and performance adaptations, but also to maximize daily and/or weekly training periodization. Cardiopulmonary responses are typically the first variables to consider when programming HIT (refer to Part I). However, anaerobic glycolytic energy contribution and neuromuscular load should also be considered to maximize the training outcome. Contrasting HIT formats that elicit similar (and maximal) cardiorespiratory responses have been associated with distinctly different anaerobic energy contributions. The high locomotor speed/power requirements of HIT (i.e. ≥95 % of the minimal velocity/power that elicits maximal oxygen uptake [v/p ̇V ̇ O2max] to 100 % of maximal sprinting speed or power) and the accumulation of high-training volumes at high-exercise intensity (runners can cover up to 6-8 km at v ̇ V ̇ O2max per session) can cause significant strain on the neuromuscular/musculoskeletal system. For athletes training twice a day, and/or in team sport players training a number of metabolic and neuromuscular systems within a weekly microcycle, this added physiological strain should be considered in light of the other physical and technical/tactical sessions, so as to avoid overload and optimize adaptation (i.e. maximize a given training stimulus and minimize musculoskeletal pain and/or injury risk). In this part of the review, the different aspects of HIT programming are discussed, from work/relief interval manipulation to HIT periodization, using different examples of training cycles from different sports, with continued reference to the cardiorespiratory adaptations outlined in Part I, as well as to anaerobic glycolytic contribution and neuromuscular/musculoskeletal load. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

Position in the peloton and number of teammates supporting the sprinter at different times before the finish line together with PO for different time intervals were determined. Sprints were classified as team Shimano (2013-2014) and team Quick-step (2016-2017), as well as won or lost. Results: The sprinter was highly successful, winning 14 out of the 21 sprints. At time intervals 10 to 5, 3 to 2, and 1.5 to 1 minute, POs were significantly lower in team Quickstep compared with team Shimano, but the sprinter was positioned further away from the front at 10, 2, 1.5, 1, and 0.5 minutes at team Quick-step compared with team Shimano. The PO was higher at time interval 0.5 to 0.25 minutes before the finish line with team Quick-step when compared with team Shimano. The position of the sprinter in the peloton in lost sprints was further away from the front at 0.5 minutes before the finish compared with won sprints, while no differences were noted for PO and the number of teammates between won and lost sprints.

abstract = {Despite an increasing amount of research devoted to middle-distance training (herein the 800 and 1500 m events), information regarding the training methodologies of world-class runners is limited. Therefore, the objective of this review was to integrate scientific and best practice literature and outline a novel framework for understanding the training and development of elite middle-distance performance. Herein, we describe how well-known training principles and fundamental training characteristics are applied by world-leading middle-distance coaches and athletes to meet the physiological and neuromuscular demands of 800 and 1500 m. Large diversities in physiological profiles and training emerge among middle-distance runners, justifying a categorization into types across a continuum (400–800 m types, 800 m specialists, 800–1500 m types, 1500 m specialists and 1500–5000 m types). Larger running volumes (120–170 vs. 50–120 km{\textperiodcentered}week−1 during the preparation period) and higher aerobic/anaerobic training distribution (90/10 vs. 60/40% of the annual running sessions below vs. at or above anaerobic threshold) distinguish 1500- and 800-m runners. Lactate tolerance and lactate production training are regularly included interval sessions by middle-distance runners, particularly among 800-m athletes. In addition, 800-m runners perform more strength, power and plyometric training than 1500-m runners. Although the literature is biased towards men and “long-distance thinking,” this review provides a point of departure for scientists and practitioners to further explore and quantify the training and development of elite 800- and 1500-m running performance and serves as a position statement for outlining current state-of-the-art middle-distance training recommendations.},

The question addressed in this review is whether altitude training should be recommended to elite athletes or not.},

abstract = {The present study aimed to examine the effectiveness of an individualized training program based on force-velocity (FV) profiling on jumping, sprinting, strength, and power in athletes. Forty national level team sport athletes (20 ± 4years, 83 ± 13 kg) from ice-hockey, handball, and soccer completed a 10-week training intervention. A theoretical optimal squat jump (SJ)-FV-profile was calculated from SJ with five different loads (0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 kg). Based on their initial FV-profile, athletes were randomized to train toward, away, or irrespective (balanced training) of their initial theoretical optimal FV-profile. The training content was matched between groups in terms of set x repetitions but varied in relative loading to target the different aspects of the FV-profile. The athletes performed 10 and 30 m sprints, SJ and countermovement jump (CMJ), 1 repetition maximum (1RM) squat, and a leg-press power test before and after the intervention. There were no significant group differences for any of the performance measures. Trivial to small changes in 1RM squat (2.9%, 4.6%, and 6.5%), 10 m sprint time (1.0%, −0.9%, and −1.7%), 30 m sprint time (0.9%, −0.6%, and −0.4%), CMJ height (4.3%, 3.1%, and 5.7%), SJ height (4.8%, 3.7%, and 5.7%), and leg-press power (6.7%, 4.2%, and 2.9%) were observed in the groups training toward, away, or irrespective of their initial theoretical optimal FV-profile, respectively. Changes toward the optimal SJ-FV-profile were negatively correlated with changes in SJ height (r = −0.49, p < 0.001). Changes in SJ-power were positively related to changes in SJ-height (r = 0.88, p < 0.001) and CMJ-height (r = 0.32, p = 0.044), but unrelated to changes in 10 m (r = −0.02, p = 0.921) and 30 m sprint time (r = −0.01, p = 0.974). The results from this study do not support the efficacy of individualized training based on SJ-FV profiling.},

abstract = {The regulation of endurance training is usually based on the prescription of exercise intensity. Exercise duration, another important variable of training load, is rarely prescribed by individual measures and mostly set from experience. As the specific exercise duration for any intensity plays a substantial role regarding the different kind of cellular stressors, degree, and kind of fatigue as well as training effects, concepts integrating the prescription of both intensity and duration within one model are needed. An according recent approach was the critical power concept which seems to have a physiological basis; however, the mathematical approach of this concept does not allow applying the three zones/two threshold model of metabolism and its different physiological consequences. Here we show the combination of exercise intensity and duration prescription on an individual basis applying the power/speed to distance/time relationship. The concept is based on both the differentiation of intensities by two lactate or gas exchange variables derived turn points, and on the relationship between power (or velocity) and duration (or distance). The turn points define three zones of intensities with distinct acute metabolic, hormonal, and cardio-respiratory responses for endurance exercise. A maximal duration exists for any single power or velocity such as described in the power-duration relationship. Using percentages of the maximal duration allows regulating fatigue, recovery time, and adaptation for any single endurance training session. Four domains of duration with respect to induced fatigue can be derived from maximal duration obtained by the power-duration curve. For any micro-cycle, target intensities and durations may be chosen on an individual basis. The model described here is the first conceptual framework of integrating physiologically defined intensities and fatigue related durations to optimize high-performance exercise training.},

abstract = {Purpose This study compared the physiological effects of a moderate-intensity interval training (MIT) microcycle followed by an active recovery period (collectively termed MITblock) with a time-matched regular training period (REG) during the general preparation phase in well-trained cyclists. Methods Using a randomized crossover design, 30 well-trained male cyclists (maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), 70.5 (4.6) mL{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) completed both MITblock and REG. The MIT microcycle involved six interval sessions over seven days with 5-7 × 10-14 min work intervals at a perceived exertion (RPE) of 14-15 on the Borg 6-20 scale. A six-day active recovery period followed before physiological testing. During REG, cyclists performed their regular preparatory-phase training routine, which primarily involved low-intensity exercise. Specific guidelines included completing either two MIT sessions or one MIT session and one high-intensity interval session per week. Endurance performance indicators assessed included changes in 15 min maximal average power output (PO15min), power output at 4 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L-1 [blood lactate] (PO4mmol), 1 min peak power output during incremental testing (POVO2max), and VO2max. Results Although the Training Impulse (TRIMP) score was not different between MITblock and REG (1944 (436) vs. 1800 (232), respectively; p = 0.27), MITblock resulted in significantly greater improvements than REG in PO4mmol (4.0 (4.4)% vs. -1.3 (3.7)%, p < 0.01), POVO2max (2.5 (4.5)% vs. -0.7 (3.9)%, p < 0.01) and VO2max (2.0 (3.9)% vs. 0.0 (3.5)%, p = 0.05). Changes in PO15min were not statistically different between MITblock and REG (3.9 (8.3)% vs. 0.2 (6.8)%, p = 0.14). During MIT intervals, RPE was 14.4 (0.3), corresponding to 66 (5)% of POVO2max, 85 (3)% of maximal heart rate, and 2.8 (1.1) mmol{\textperiodcentered}L-1 [blood lactate]. Conclusions Six moderate-intensity interval sessions over seven days, followed by a six-day active recovery period, induce improvements in endurance performance indicators compared to a time-matched regular training period in well-trained cyclists.

Heart rate (HR) showed an initial cardiovascular drift and progressively decreased independently of power. A decreased HR variability, a marked inflammatory response, signs of muscle damage and alterations of the haematological profile were observed after the trial. These adverse physiological effects were still present 24–48 h after exercise. A reduction in handgrip maximal voluntary contraction was observed immediately after the trial and 24 h later despite these muscles being minimally active during exercise.

abstract = {Objective: To determine the acute effect of fasted and fed exercise on energy intake, energy expenditure, subjective hunger and gastrointestinal hormone release. Methods: CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were searched to identify randomised, crossover studies in healthy individuals that compared the following interventions: (i) fasted exercise with a standardised post-exercise meal [FastEx + Meal], (ii) fasted exercise without a standardised post-exercise meal [FastEx + NoMeal], (iii) fed exercise with a standardised post-exercise meal [FedEx + Meal], (iv) fed exercise without a standardised post-exercise meal [FedEx + NoMeal]. Studies must have measured ad libitum meal energy intake, within-lab energy intake, 24-h energy intake, energy expenditure, subjective hunger, acyl-ghrelin, peptide YY, and/or glucagon-like peptide 1. Random-effect network meta-analyses were performed for outcomes containing ≥5 studies. Results: 17 published articles (23 studies) were identified. Ad libitum meal energy intake was significantly lower during FedEx + Meal compared to FedEx + NoMeal (MD: −489 kJ; 95% CI, −898 to −80 kJ; P = 0.019). Within-lab energy intake was significantly lower during FastEx + NoMeal compared to FedEx + NoMeal (MD: −1326 kJ; 95% CI, −2102 to −550 kJ; P = 0.001). Similarly, 24-h energy intake following FastEx + NoMeal was significantly lower than FedEx + NoMeal (MD: −2095 kJ; 95% CI, −3910 kJ to −280 kJ; P = 0.024). Energy expenditure was however significantly lower during FastEx + NoMeal compared to FedEx+NoMeal (MD: −0.67 kJ/min; 95% CI, −1.10 to −0.23 kJ/min; P = 0.003). Subjective hunger was significantly higher during FastEx + Meal (MD: 13 mm; 95% CI, 5–21 mm; P = 0.001) and FastEx + NoMeal (MD: 23 mm; 95% CI, 16–30 mm; P < 0.001) compared to FedEx + NoMeal. Conclusion: FastEx + NoMeal appears to be the most effective strategy to produce a short-term decrease in energy intake, but also results in increased hunger and lowered energy expenditure. Concerns regarding experimental design however lower the confidence in these findings, necessitating future research to rectify these issues when investigating exercise meal timing and energy balance. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020208041. Key points: Fed exercise with a standardised post-exercise meal resulted in the lowest energy intake at the ad libitum meal served following exercise completion.Fasted exercise without a standardised post-exercise meal resulted in the lowest within-lab and 24-h energy intake, but also produced the lowest energy expenditure and highest hunger.Methodological issues lower the confidence in these findings and necessitate future work to address identified problems.},

abstract = {Purpose: To provide novel insight regarding the influence of exercise modality on training load management by (1) providing a theoretical framework for the impact of physiological and biomechanical mechanisms associated with different exercise modalities on training load management in endurance exercise and (2) comparing effort-matched low-intensity training sessions performed by top-level athletes in endurance sports with similar energy demands. Practical Applications and Conclusions: The ability to perform endurance training with manageable muscular loads and low injury risks in different exercise modalities is influenced both by mechanical factors and by muscular state and coordination, which interrelate in optimizing power production while reducing friction and/or drag. Consequently, the choice of exercise modality in endurance training influences effort beyond commonly used external and internal load measurements and should be considered alongside duration, frequency, and intensity when managing training load. By comparing effort-matched low- to moderate-intensity sessions performed by top-level athletes in endurance sports, this study exemplifies how endurance exercise with varying modalities leads to different tolerable volumes. For example, the weight-bearing exercise and high-impact forces in long-distance running put high loads on muscles and tendons, leading to relatively low training volume tolerance. In speed skating, the flexed knee and hip position required for effective speed skating leads to occlusion of thighs and low volume tolerance. In contrast, the non-weight-bearing, low-contraction exercises in cycling or swimming allow for large volumes in the specific exercise modalities. Overall, these differences have major implications on training load management in sports.},

abstract = {Introduction: Scientific and public interest in the potential ergogenic effects of sodium alginate added to a carbohydrate (CHO) beverage has increased in the last $\sim$ 5 years. Despite an extensive use of this technology by elite athletes and recent research into the potential effects, there has been no meta-analysis to objectively elucidate the effects of adding sodium alginate to a CHO beverage on parameters relevant to exercise performance and to highlight gaps in the literature. Methods: Three literature databases were systematically searched for studies investigating the effects of sodium alginate added to CHO beverage during prolonged, endurance exercise in healthy athletes. For the systematic review, the PROSPERO guidelines were followed, and risk assessment was made using the Cochrane collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias. Additionally, a random-effects meta-analysis model was used to determine the standardised mean difference between a CHO beverage containing sodium alginate and an isocaloric control for performance, whole-body CHO oxidation and blood glucose concentration. Results: Ten studies were reviewed systematically, of which seven were included within the meta-analysis. For each variable, there was homogeneity between studies for performance (n = 5 studies; I2 = 0%), CHO oxidation (n = 7 studies; I2 = 0%) and blood glucose concentration (n = 7 studies; I2 = 0%). When compared with an isocaloric control, the meta-analysis demonstrated that there is no difference in performance (Z = 0.54, p = 0.59), CHO oxidation (Z = 0.34, p = 0.71) and blood glucose concentration (Z = 0.44, p = 0.66) when ingesting a CHO beverage containing sodium alginate. The systematic review revealed that several of the included studies did not use sufficient exercise intensity to elicit significant gastrointestinal disturbances or demonstrate any ergogenic benefit of CHO ingestion. Risk of bias was generally low across the included studies. Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate that the current literature indicates no benefit of adding sodium alginate to a CHO beverage during exercise. Further research is required, however, before firm conclusions are drawn considering the range of exercise intensities, feeding rates and the apparent lack of benefit of CHO reported in the current literature investigating sodium alginate.},

abstract = {Purpose: To describe the intensity, load, and performance characteristics of a world-class sprinter competing in the Tour de France (TdF). Method: Power output (PO) data were collected from 4 editions of the TdF (2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017) and analyzed. Load, intensity distribution in 5 PO zones, and the maximal mean PO for multiple durations were quantified. Stages were divided in accordance with the 4 different editions of the TdF, as well as the 4 different stage types, that is, flat (FLAT), semimountainous (SMT), mountain (MT), and (team) time trials. In addition, based on their location within the stage, mountain passes were further classified as BEGINNING, MIDDLE, or END of the stage. Results: No differences in load, intensity, and performance characteristics were found when the 4 editions of the TdF were compared. Time trials were associated with higher intensities but a lower load compared to the other stage types. MT showed higher load and intensity values compared to FLAT and SMT stages. FLAT stages were higher in short maximal mean PO (≤1 min), whereas MT stages showed higher longer endurance maximal mean PO values (≥20 min). In addition, mountain passes situated at the BEGINNING of the stage were completed with a higher PO, cadence, and speed compared with mountain passes situated at the END. Conclusions: A worldclass sprinter sustains a higher load and spends more time in the high-intensity zones when competing in the TdF than previously reported values suggested.

abstract = {Purpose: Enteric-coated sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) can attenuate gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms following acute bicarbonate loading, although the subsequent effects on exercise performance have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of enteric-coated NaHCO3 supplementation on high-intensity exercise performance and GI symptoms. Methods: Eleven trained male cyclists completed three 4 km time trials after consuming; a placebo or 0.3 g∙kg–1 body mass NaHCO3 in enteric-coated or gelatin capsules. Exercise trials were timed with individual peak blood bicarbonate ion concentration ([HCO3–]). Blood acid–base balance was measured pre-ingestion, pre-exercise, and post-exercise, whereas GI symptoms were recorded pre-ingestion and immediately pre-exercise. Results: Pre-exercise blood [HCO3−] and potential hydrogen (pH) were greater for both NaHCO3 conditions (P < 0.0005) when compared to placebo. Performance time was faster with enteric-coated (− 8.5 ± 9.6 s, P = 0.044) and gelatin (− 9.6 ± 7.2 s, P = 0.004) NaHCO3 compared to placebo, with no significant difference between conditions (mean difference = 1.1 ± 5.3 s, P = 1.000). Physiological responses were similar between conditions, although blood lactate ion concentration was higher with gelatin NaHCO3 (2.4 ± 1.7 mmol∙L–1, P = 0.003) compared with placebo. Furthermore, fewer participants experienced GI symptoms with enteric-coated (n = 3) compared to gelatin (n = 7) NaHCO3. Discussion: Acute enteric-coated NaHCO3 consumption mitigates GI symptoms at the onset of exercise and improves subsequent 4 km cycling TT performance. Athletes who experience GI side-effects after acute bicarbonate loading may, therefore, benefit from enteric-coated NaHCO3 supplementation prior to exercise performance.},

L-1) for on-snow classical skiing compared to the other modes, both P < 0.05. An increase in HR and Bla- was observed from interval working periods 1 to 3 (90-92% of HRmax and 6.5-7.7 mmol . L-1) and further from 3 to 5 (92-93% of HRmax and 7.7-9.0 mmol . L-1), all P < 0.05. Conclusions: We describe long-term use of HIT-block periodization among world-class XC skiers who achieved target HR and Bla- levels in all six exercise modes employed. According to athletes and coaches, the key to successful blocks was intensity control to allow for high-quality HIT sessions throughout the entire HIT block.

abstract = {Purpose: The primary purpose of this investigation was to compare the recovery of the W′ to the recovery of intramuscular substrates and metabolites using 31P- and 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Methods: Ten healthy recreationally trained subjects were tested to determine critical power (CP) and W′ for single-leg-extensor exercise. They subsequently exercised in the bore of a 1.5-T MRI scanner at a supra-CP work rate. Following exhaustion, the subjects rested in place for 1, 2, 5 or 7 min, and then repeated the effort. The temporal course of W′ recovery was estimated, which was then compared to the recovery of creatine phosphate [PCr], pH, carnosine content, and to the output of a novel derivation of the W′BAL model. Results: W′ recovery closely correlated with the predictions of the novel model (r = 0.97, p = 0.03). [PCr] recovered faster (Formula presented.) than W′(Formula presented.) The W′ available for the second exercise bout was directly correlated with the difference between [PCr] at the beginning of the work bout and [PCr] at exhaustion (r = 0.99, p = 0.005). Nonlinear regression revealed an inverse curvilinear relationship between carnosine concentration and the W′t1/2 (r2 = 0.55). Conclusion: The kinetics of W′ recovery in single-leg-extensor exercise is comparable to that observed in whole-body exercise, suggesting a conserved mechanism. The extent to which the recovery of the W′ can be directly attributed to the recovery of [PCr] is unclear. The relationship of the W′ to muscle carnosine content suggests novel future avenues of investigation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this systematic literature review was to outline the various preexperimental maximal cycle-test protocols, terminology, and performance indicators currently used to classify subject groups in sport-science research and to construct a classification system for cycling-related research. METHODS: A database of 130 subject-group descriptions contains information on preexperimental maximal cycle-protocol designs, terminology of the subject groups, biometrical and physiological data, cycling experience, and parameters. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, 1-way ANOVA, post hoc Bonferroni (P < .05), and trend lines were calculated on height, body mass, relative and absolute maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2max)), and peak power output (PPO). RESULTS: During preexperimental testing, an initial workload of 100 W and a workload increase of 25 W are most frequently used. Three-minute stages provide the most reliable and valid measures of endurance performance. After obtaining data on a subject group, researchers apply various terms to define the group. To solve this complexity, the authors introduced the neutral term performance levels 1 to 5, representing untrained, recreationally trained, trained, well-trained, and professional subject groups, respectively. The most cited parameter in literature to define subject groups is relative VO(2max), and therefore no overlap between different performance levels may occur for this principal parameter. Another significant cycling parameter is the absolute PPO. The description of additional physiological information and current and past cycling data is advised. CONCLUSION: This review clearly shows the need to standardize the procedure for classifying subject groups. Recommendations are formulated concerning preexperimental testing, terminology, and performance indicators.},

@article{Issurin2016,
abstract = {The present review introduces innovative concepts of training periodization and summarizes a large body of findings characterizing their potential benefits and possible limitations. Evidence-based analysis of the traditional periodization model led to elaboration of alternative versions of athletic preparation. These alternative versions postulated the superiority of training programs with a high concentration of selected workloads compared with traditionally designed plans directed at the concurrent development of many athletic abilities at low/medium workload concentration. The training cycles of highly concentrated specialized workloads were coined “training blocks” by experts and practitioners; correspondingly, the alternative versions were termed “block periodized (BP) preparation systems” by their presenters. Ultimately, two BP training models were proposed: a concentrated unidirectional training model (CU) and a multi-targeted BP approach to athletes' preparation. The first innovative version postulated administration of highly concentrated training means for enhancement of one leading fitness component, whereas the second version proposed the development of many targeted abilities within sequenced block mesocycles containing a minimal number of compatible training modalities. Both versions differ in their methodological background, duration and content of training blocks, possibilities of providing multi-peak performances, and applicability to various sports. In recent decades, many studies have evaluated the effects of both BP training versions in different sports. Examination of the training effects producing by the CU model in combat and team sports has found significant gains in various fitness estimates but not in sport-specific performances. Similarly, utilization of a CU program by elite swimmers did not lead to substantial enhancement of their peak performances. In contrast, studies of multi-targeted BP training programs have revealed their distinct superiority compared with traditional preparation in endurance, team, and dual sports, and strength/power training and recreational athletes (28 studies). It is suggested that the CU training strategy suits athletic disciplines demanding one fitness component like explosive strength in jumping performances. Unlike this limitation, the multi-targeted BP system prompted a beneficial increase of specific preparedness in sports and disciplines in which peak performances require the application of many targeted athletic abilities.},

abstract = {Current convention place peak power as the main determinant of sprint cycling performance. This study challenges that notion and compares two common durations of sprint cycling performance with not only peak power, but power out to 20-min. There is also a belief where maximal efforts of longer durations will be detrimental to sprint cycling performance. 56 data sets from 27 cyclists (21 male, 6 female) provided maximal power for durations from 1-s to 20-min. Peak power values are compared to assess the strength of correlation (R2), and any relationship (slope) across every level. R2 between 15-s- 30-s power and durations from 1-s to 20-min remained high (R2 ≥ 0.83). Despite current assumptions around 1-s power, our data shows this relationship is stronger around competition durations, and 1-s power also still shared strong relationships with longer durations out to 20-min. Slopes for relationships at shorter durations were closer to a 1:1 relationship than longer durations, but closer to long-duration slopes than to a 1:1 line. The present analyses contradicts both wellaccepted hypotheses that peak power is the main driver of sprint cycling performance and that maximal efforts of longer durations out to 20-min will hinder sprint cycling. This study shows the importance and potential of training durations from 1-s to 20-min over a preparation period to improve competition sprint cycling performance. Copyright:},

Demarcation of intensity from 3 to 5 zones aids in understanding physiological performance progression in highly trained under-23 rowing athletes. J Strength Cond Res 37(11): e593-e600, 2023 - The purpose of this investigation was to compare 2 training intensity distribution models (3 and 5 zone) in 15 highly trained rowing athletes (n = 8 male; n = 7 female; 19.4 ± 1.1 years) to determine the impact on primary (2,000-m single-scull race) and secondary (2,000-m ergometer time trial, peak oxygen consumption [VO2peak], lactate threshold 2 [LT2 power]) performance variables. Performance was assessed before and after 4 months training, which was monitored through a smart watch (Garmin Ltd, Olathe, KS) and chest-strap heart rate (HR) monitor (Wahoo Fitness, Atlanta, GA). Two training intensity distribution models were quantified and compared: a 3-zone model (Z1: between 50% VO2peak and lactate threshold 1 (LT1); Z2: between LT1 and 95% LT2; Z3: >95% LT2) and a 5-zone model (T1-T5), where Z1 and Z3 were split into 2 additional zones. There was significant improvement in LT2 power for both male (4.08% ± 1.83, p < 0.01) and female (3.52% ± 3.38, p = 0.02) athletes, with male athletes also demonstrating significant improvement in 2,000-m ergometer time trial (2.3% ± 1.92, p = 0.01). Changes in VO2peak significantly correlated with high-quality aerobic training (percent time in T2 zone; r = 0.602, p = 0.02), whereas changes in LT2 power significantly correlated with "threshold" training (percent time in T4 zone; r = 0.529, p = 0.04). These correlations were not evident when examining intensity distribution through the 3-zone model. Accordingly, a 5-zone intensity model may aid in understanding the progression of secondary performance metrics in rowing athletes; however, primary (on-water) performance remains complex to quantify.},

abstract = {The skeletal muscle phenotype is subject to considerable malleability depending on use as well as internal and external cues. In humans, low-load endurance-type exercise leads to qualitative changes of muscle tissue characterized by an increase in structures supporting oxygen delivery and consumption, such as capillaries and mitochondria. High-load strength-type exercise leads to growth of muscle fibers dominated by an increase in contractile proteins. In endurance exercise, stress-induced signaling leads to transcriptional upregulation of genes, with Ca2+ signaling and the energy status of the muscle cells sensed through AMPK being major input determinants. Several interrelated signaling pathways converge on the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1a, perceived to be the coordinator of much of the transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. Strength training is dominated by a translational upregulation controlled by mTORC1. mTORC1 is mainly regulated by an insulin- and/or growth-factor-dependent signaling cascade as well as mechanical and nutritional cues. Muscle growth is further supported by DNA recruitment through activation and incorporation of satellite cells. In addition, there are several negative regulators of muscle mass. We currently have a good descriptive understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the muscle phenotype. The topology of signaling networks seems highly conserved among species, with the signaling outcome being dependent on the particular way individual species make use of the options offered by the multi-nodal networks. As a consequence, muscle structural and functional modifications can be achieved by an almost unlimited combination of inputs and downstream signaling events.},

Design: Power output information was derived from laboratory and field-testing during pre-season and mean maximal power outputs (MMP) from racing season. Absolute and relative 5-min MMP, 5-min MMP after 2000 kJ (MMP2000 kJ), allometric scaling and the compound score were compared to the race score and podium (top 3) performance during a competitive season. Methods: Positive and negative predictive values were calculated for all significant performance variables for the likelihood of a podium performance. Results: The absolute 5-min MMP of the field test revealed the highest negative predictive capacity (82.4%, p = 0.012) for a podium performance. The compound score of the 5-min MMP2000 kJ demonstrated the highest positive and average predictive capacity (83.3%, 78.0%, p = 0.007 - respectively). The multi-linear regression analysis revealed a significant predictive capacity between performance variables and the race score (R2 = 0.55, p = 0.015). Conclusions: Collectively the results of the present study reveal that the compound score, alongside absolute power, was able to predict the highest positive and average likelihood for a podium performance. These findings can help to better understand performance capacity from field data to predict future cycling success.},

abstract = { Purpose: To analyze the relationship between critical power (CP) and different lactate threshold (LT2) markers in cyclists.  Methods: Seventeen male recreational cyclists [33 ± 5 years, peak power output (PO) = 4.5 ± 0.7 W/kg] were included in the study. The PO associated with four different fixed (onset of blood lactate accumulation) and individualized (Dmax exp , Dmax pol , and LT $\Delta$1 ) LT2 markers was determined during a maximal incremental cycling test, and CP was calculated from three trials of 1-, 5-, and 20-min duration. The relationship and agreement between each LT2 marker and CP were then analyzed.  Results: Strong correlations ( r = 0.81–0.98 for all markers) and trivial-to-small non-significant differences (Hedges' g = 0.01–0.17, bias = 1–9 W, and p > 0.05) were found between all LT2 markers and CP with the exception of Dmax exp , which showed the strongest correlation but was slightly higher than the CP (Hedges' g = 0.43, bias = 20 W, and p < 0.001). Wide limits of agreement (LoA) were, however, found for all LT2 markers compared with CP (from ±22 W for Dmax exp to ±52 W for Dmax pol ), and unclear to most likely practically meaningful differences (PO differences between markers >1%, albeit <5%) were found between markers attending to magnitude-based inferences.  Conclusion: LT2 markers show a strong association and overall trivial-to-small differences with CP. Nevertheless, given the wide LoA and the likelihood of potentially meaningful differences between these endurance-related markers, caution should be employed when using them interchangeably. },

Maximal cycle ergometry tests were performed in 496 male and 84 female competitive cyclists. Six predictors were initially used to model the prediction equation (power output, body weight, body height, fat mass, fat-free mass and age). Power output and body weight were the most important parameters in the model predicting VO2max. Three new equations were derived: for male (VO2max = 0.10 × PO − 0.60 × BW + 64.21), female cyclists (0.13 × PO − 0.83 × BW + 64.02) and the non-gender-specific formula (0.12 × PO − 0.65 × BW + 59.78). The ACSM underestimated VO2max in men by 7.32 mL/min/kg (11.54%), in women by 8.24 mL/min/kg (15.04%) and in all participants by 7.45 mL/min/kg (11.99%), compared to the new equation that underestimated VO2max in men by 0.12 mL/min/kg (0.19%) and in all participants by 0.65 mL/min/kg (1.04%). In female cyclists, the new equation had no relative bias. We recommend that medicine and sports practitioners adapt our proposed equations when working with competitive cyclists. Our findings demonstrate the need to evaluate prediction models for other athletes with a special focus on disciplines that demand high aerobic capacity.},

abstract = {The application of molecular techniques to exercise biology has provided novel insight into the complexity and breadth of intracellular signaling networks involved in response to endurance-based exercise. Here we discuss several strategies that have high uptake by athletes and, on mechanistic grounds, have the potential to promote cellular adaptation to endurance training in skeletal muscle. Such approaches are based on the underlying premise that imposing a greater metabolic load and provoking extreme perturbations in cellular homeostasis will augment acute exercise responses that, when repeated over months and years, will amplify training adaptation. Many of the contemporary training strategies undertaken by elite endurance athletes, such as altitude training, heat acclimatization, and periodization of fuel availability, can now be explained by the principle of enhanced cellular adaptation in skeletal muscle, induced by the increased metabolic load or greater perturbation in cellular homeostasis imposed by these practices.},

abstract = {The fact that road cycling is an endurance sport is generally not up for discussion. However, new research on endurance provides food for thought. Are we looking at the right parameters to assess the performance level of a road cyclist? Are we selecting young talents the right way? And, are we, as trainer/coaches, emphasizing the right things in their training? _________________ Marco van Bon Road cycling races are decided during so-called critical periods. 1,2 These are periods during a race when riders really need to unleash their power in order to force the course of the race into a personal advantage. 1 Critical periods are therefore also called 'race-winning efforts'. 3 An example of a critical period is when a rider attacks and tries to break-away from a group, or tries to close the gap towards the group in front of him. Periods in which a cyclist is hammering at the front of the leading group in order to stay away, or an explosive final sprint at the finish line, can also be considered as critical periods. Critical periods are race-specific and determined by the course (gradient, cobbled sections, etc.), conditions (wind, altitude, temperature, etc.), the length of the race and race tactics. Based on specific race situations and the energy systems that are utilized during these situations, we can roughly divide these critical periods into three time spans: short (between 5 and 60 seconds), medium (from 1 minute to 10 minutes), and long critical periods (from 10 minutes onwards). 1 These periods typically occur several times during a race and may not directly lead to the decisive move. Although critical moments also occur in the beginning or halfway through a race and may determine the outcome of a race, the real 'race-winning efforts' are generally made in the final stage ('final') of a race. At that point of the race, professional cyclists have been riding for more than four hours meaning that decisive efforts are often made at moments when fatigue comes into play. 4 Durability or fatigue resistance Since 2021, the importance of fatigue in road cycling has grabbed the attention of researchers, as reflected in the massive increase in number of articles on this topic in sports science literature. In their influential paper about fatigue, Ed Maunder and Stephen Seiler (the man behind polarized training) where the first to introduce the term durability. 5 They describe durability as the ability to resist the influence of fatigue.},

abstract = {Purpose: The concept of training quality reflects that the effect of training is dependent on more than the mere product of training load (eg, duration, intensity, frequency). The aims of this commentary are to (1) propose a practice-oriented framework to describe training quality and its general and context-dependent characteristics and (2) discuss how athletes and coaches can work to improve training quality. Conclusions: Training quality can be viewed from different perspectives. The holistic dimension includes the entire training process (goal setting, gap analysis, application of training principles and methods, etc), while a narrower dimension encompasses the specific training sessions and how they are executed in relation to the intended purpose. To capture the varying contexts, we define training quality as the degree of excellence related to how the training process or training sessions are executed to optimize adaptations and, thereby, improve overall performance. Although training quality is challenging to quantify, we argue that identification and assessment of quality indicators will increase our scientific understanding and consequently help coaches and athletes to improve training quality. We propose that the physical, technical, and psychological factors of training quality can be improved through an individualized learning process of systematic planning, execution, and debriefing. However, assessment tools should be identified and scientifically validated across different training sessions and sports. We encourage further interventions to improve training quality.},

Here, we investigated whether exercise-induced increases in these and other markers of mitochondrial biogenesis were altered after 40 sessions of twice-daily high-volume, high-intensity interval training (HVT) in human skeletal muscle. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were collected from 10 healthy recreationally active participants before, immediately postexercise, and 3 h after a session of high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) performed at the same absolute exercise intensity before and after HVT (pre-HVT and post-HVT, respectively). The protein content of common markers of exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis was assessed in nuclear- and cytosolic-enriched fractions by immunoblotting; mRNA contents of key transcription factors and mitochondrial genes were assessed by qPCR. Despite exercise-induced increases in PGC-1$\alpha$, p53, and plant homeodomain finger-containing protein 20 (PHF20) protein content, the phosphorylation of p53 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (p-p53 Ser15 and p-ACC Ser79, respectively), and PGC-1$\alpha$ mRNA Pre-HVT, no significant changes were observed post-HVT. Forty sessions of twice-daily high-intensity interval training blunted all of the measured exercise-induced molecular events associated with mitochondrial biogenesis that were observed pre-HVT.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Twenty-minute test proposed by Allen & Coggan and cycling test to exhaustion were used to obtain the functional threshold power and a time to exhaustion. Cyclists were divided into performance groups based into 4 categories according to their VO2max. Results: The median (interquartile range) time to exhaustion at the functional threshold power was 35 (31–38) minutes for recreationally trained cyclists, 42 (38–51) for trained ones, 47 (41–56) for well-trained ones and 51 (44–59) for professional level cyclists. Time to exhaustion increased with cyclists' experience and performance level (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The high time to exhaustion variability observed in this study suggests that functional threshold power and time to exhaustion should be assessed and reported independently for each subject. Also, cyclists' performance level and experience should be factored in when attempting to study the time to exhaustion, as better performing and more experienced cyclists consistently show longer times to exhaustion at the functional threshold power.},

abstract = {Background: Repeated exposure to heat (ie, plasma volume expansion) or altitude (ie, increase in total hemoglobin mass), in conjunction with exercise, induces hematological adaptations that enhance endurance performance in each respective environment. Recently, combining heat and altitude training has become increasingly common for athletes preparing to compete in temperate, sea-level conditions. Purpose: To review the physiological adaptations to training interventions combining thermal and hypoxic stimuli and summarize the implications for temperate, sea-level performance. Current Evidence: To date, research on combining heat and hypoxia has employed 2 main approaches: simultaneously combining the stressors during training or concurrently training in the heat and sleeping at altitude, sometimes with additional training in hypoxia. When environmental stimuli are combined in a training session, improvements in aerobic fitness and time-trial performance in temperate, sea-level conditions are generally similar in magnitude to those observed with heat, or altitude, training alone. Similarly, training in the heat and sleeping at altitude does not appear to provide any additional hematological or nonhematological benefits for temperate; sea-level performance relative to training in hot, hypoxic, or control conditions. Conclusions: Current research regarding combined heat and altitude interventions does not seem to indicate that it enhances temperate, sea-level performance to a greater extent than “traditional” (heat or hypoxia alone) training approaches. A major challenge in implementing combined-stressor approaches lies in the uncertainty surrounding the prescription of dosing regimens (ie, exercise and environmental stress). The potential benefits of conducting heat and altitude exposure sequentially (ie, one after the other) warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {Physical inactivity represents the fourth leading risk factor for mortality, and it has been linked with a series of chronic disorders, the treatment of which absorbs $\sim$ 85% of healthcare costs in developed countries. Conversely, physical activity promotes many health benefits; endurance exercise in particular represents a powerful stimulus to induce mitochondrial biogenesis, and it is routinely used to prevent and treat chronic metabolic disorders linked with sub-optimal mitochondrial characteristics. Given the importance of maintaining a healthy mitochondrial pool, it is vital to better characterize how manipulating the endurance exercise dose affects cellular mechanisms of exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. Herein, we propose a definition of mitochondrial biogenesis and the techniques available to assess it, and we emphasize the importance of standardizing biopsy timing and the determination of relative exercise intensity when comparing different studies. We report an intensity-dependent regulation of exercise-induced increases in nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ coactivator-1$\alpha$ (PGC-1$\alpha$) protein content, nuclear phosphorylation of p53 (serine 15), and PGC-1$\alpha$ messenger RNA (mRNA), as well as training-induced increases in PGC-1$\alpha$ and p53 protein content. Despite evidence that PGC-1$\alpha$ protein content plateaus within a few exercise sessions, we demonstrate that greater training volumes induce further increases in PGC-1$\alpha$ (and p53) protein content, and that short-term reductions in training volume decrease the content of both proteins, suggesting training volume is still a factor affecting training-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. Finally, training-induced changes in mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) protein content are regulated in a training volume-dependent manner and have been linked with training-induced changes in mitochondrial content.},

However, controversy exists on whether performance monitoring through power-output data could be of help for antidoping purposes. Purpose : The objective of the present study was to provide insight into the feasibility and utility of implementing power-based performance monitoring in elite cycling. An expert panel of 15 applied sport scientists and professional cycling coaches were asked for their opinions and perspectives on incorporating power data into the antidoping risk-assessment process. Results : Two different viewpoints were identified from the responses provided by the experts. Some believed that power monitoring could be implemented as an antidoping tool, provided that several surmountable challenges are first addressed. These authors provided suggestions related to the potential practical implementation of such measures. Others, on the contrary, believed that power meters lack sufficient reliability and suggest that the professional cycling world presents conflicts of interest that make this intervention impossible to implement nowadays. Conclusions : The debate around the utility of power-meter data in the antidoping fight has been ongoing for more than a decade. According to the opinions provided by the experts' panel, there is still no consensus on the real utility and practical implementation of this intervention.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this systematic literature review was to outline the various preexperimental maximal cycle-test protocols, terminology, and performance indicators currently used to classify subject groups in sport-science research and to construct a classification system for cycling-related research. METHODS: A database of 130 subject-group descriptions contains information on preexperimental maximal cycle-protocol designs, terminology of the subject groups, biometrical and physiological data, cycling experience, and parameters. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, 1-way ANOVA, post hoc Bonferroni (P < .05), and trend lines were calculated on height, body mass, relative and absolute maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2max)), and peak power output (PPO). RESULTS: During preexperimental testing, an initial workload of 100 W and a workload increase of 25 W are most frequently used. Three-minute stages provide the most reliable and valid measures of endurance performance. After obtaining data on a subject group, researchers apply various terms to define the group. To solve this complexity, the authors introduced the neutral term performance levels 1 to 5, representing untrained, recreationally trained, trained, well-trained, and professional subject groups, respectively. The most cited parameter in literature to define subject groups is relative VO(2max), and therefore no overlap between different performance levels may occur for this principal parameter. Another significant cycling parameter is the absolute PPO. The description of additional physiological information and current and past cycling data is advised. CONCLUSION: This review clearly shows the need to standardize the procedure for classifying subject groups. Recommendations are formulated concerning preexperimental testing, terminology, and performance indicators.},

Novel erythropoietic substances, such as mimetics of erythropoietin (Epo) and activators of the Epo gene, may soon enter the sports scene. In addition, Epo gene transfer maneuvers are imaginable. Effective since December 2009, the World Anti-Doping Agency has therefore implemented "Athlete Biologic Passport Operating Guidelines," which are based on the monitoring of several parameters for mature red blood cells and reticulocytes.

abstract = {Heat acclimation is associated with plasma volume (PV) expansion that occurs within the first week of exposure. However, prolonged effects on hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) are unclear as intervention periods in previous studies have not allowed sufficient time for erythropoiesis to manifest. Therefore, Hbmass, intravascular volumes, and blood volume (BV)-regulating hormones were assessed with 5½ weeks of exercise-heat acclimation (HEAT) or matched training in cold conditions (CON) in 21 male cyclists [(mean ± SD) age: 38 ± 9 years, body weight: 80.4 ± 7.9 kg, VO2peak: 59.1 ± 5.2 ml/min/kg]. HEAT (n = 12) consisted of 1 h cycling at 60% VO2peak in 40°C for 5 days/week in addition to regular training, whereas CON (n = 9) trained exclusively in cold conditions (<15°C). Before and after the intervention, Hbmass and intravascular volumes were assessed by carbon monoxide rebreathing, while reticulocyte count and BV-regulating hormones were measured before, after 2 weeks and post intervention. Total training volume during the intervention was similar (p = 0.282) between HEAT (509 ± 173 min/week) and CON (576 ± 143 min/week). PV increased (p = 0.004) in both groups, by 303 ± 345 ml in HEAT and 188 ± 286 ml in CON. There was also a main effect of time (p = 0.038) for Hbmass with +34 ± 36 g in HEAT and +2 ± 33 g in CON and a tendency toward a higher increase in Hbmass in HEAT compared to CON (time × group interaction: p = 0.061). The Hbmass changes were weakly correlated to alterations in PV (r = 0.493, p = 0.023). Reticulocyte count and BV-regulating hormones remained unchanged for both groups. In conclusion, Hbmass was slightly increased following prolonged training in the heat and although the mechanistic link remains to be revealed, the increase could represent a compensatory response in erythropoiesis secondary to PV expansion.},

abstract = {  Purpose :  To investigate the training and development process of a multiple-Grand-Slam finalist.  Methods :  A mixed-methods case-study design was used to capture the quantitative and qualitative aspects related to the training and successful development process. We used a 3-step data-collection process and pragmatic analyses of (1) training history based on logs, plans, and questionnaires; (2) in-depth semistructured interviews with the player's head coach/father, physical coach, and team administrator/mother; and (3) systematic quality assurance through negotiation among researchers and all key informants, including the player.  Results :  The player's exceptional performance level was achieved by a progressive, nonlinear increase in annual training load during childhood and early youth, stabilizing at 800 sessions and 1250 to 1300 hours per year at the age of 19. The annual tennis-specific training plateaued at ∼750 hours from the age of 15, and 60 to 80 matches were played in most of the analyzed years. Point-play accounted for approximately 50% of the total amount of specific tennis training, clearly ahead of ground strokes (∼30%), serve/return (∼15%), and smash/volley (∼5%). Physical-conditioning hours increased 5-fold from 12 to 19 years, before stabilizing at ∼500 hours at senior age. Key success factors included the athlete's multidimensional sports talent, discipline, and inner drive; a highly dedicated father and tennis-enthusiastic family; and strong support from a complementary and interdisciplinary performance team.  Conclusion :  This study provides novel information regarding the training and development process for a world-leading tennis player, providing a point of departure for the development of future talents. },

abstract = {Physiological resilience or durability is now recognised as a determinant of  endurance performance such as road cycling. Reliable, ecologically valid and standardised performance tests in laboratory-based cycling protocols have to be established to investigate mechanisms underpinning, and interventions improving durability. This review aims to provide an overview of available race simulation protocols in the literature and examines its rigour around themes that influence durability including (i) exercise intensity anchoring and (ii) carbohydrate intake whilst also (iii) inspecting reliability and justification of the developed protocols. Using a systematic search approach, 48 articles were identified that met our criteria as a cycling race simulation. Most protocols presented limitations to be recommended as exercise test to investigate durability, such as not appropriately addressing the influence of exercise intensity domains by anchoring exercise intensity as % peak power or % V˙ O(2max). Ten articles provided reliability data, but only one articles under the appropriate conditions. Most studies sufficiently controlled nutrition during trials but not in the days leading to the trials or just before the trials. Thus, there is a paucity in protocols that combine justification and reliability with optimal nutritional support and mimic the true demands of a road-cycling race. This review lists an overview of protocols that researchers could use with caution to select a protocol for future experiments, but encourages further development of improved protocols, including utilisation of virtual software applications.},

Methods Data were collected from 10 professional cyclists (age = 19.2 ± 0.8 yr, body mass = 70.4 ± 5.5 kg, height = 182.9 ± 4.0 cm, body mass index = 21.0 ± 1.3 kg{\textperiodcentered}m-2, VO2max = 74.4 ± 4.8 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min -1, critical power [CP] = 5.6 ± 0.6 W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1, W′ = 23.7 ± 5.4 kJ). Participants completed a laboratory test and a CP test on two occasions. The second occasion was preceded by a novel fatiguing protocol, which consisted of five bouts of 8-min of exercise at 105%-110% of CP. CP in a fatigued state was expressed as a percentage of the fresh CP and coined delta CP ($\Delta$CP). The Pearson product correlation analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between laboratory-based measures and $\Delta$CP. Results Significant positive relationships were found between $\Delta$CP and relative peak power output (r = 0.891, P < 0.001), relative maximum oxygen uptake (r = 0.835, P = 0.003), relative power output at the second ventilatory threshold (r = 0.738, P = 0.015), power output at the first ventilatory threshold (r = 0.748, P = 0.013) and relative power output at the first ventilatory threshold (r = 0.826, P = 0.003), gross efficiency at 300 W (r = 0.869, P = 0.001), and at 200 W (r = 0.792, P = 0.006). Significant negative relationships were found between $\Delta$CP and carbohydrate oxidation at 200 W (r =-0.702, P = 0.024). A multiple linear regression demonstrated that $\Delta$CP can be predicted from laboratory measures (R2 = 0.96-0.98, P < 0.001). Conclusions These findings demonstrate the physiological determinants of durability in a professional cycling population.},

abstract = {Hypervolemia is a hallmark of endurance training (ET) and manifests by similar elevations in plasma (PV) and red blood cell volume (RBCV) so that hematocrit largely remains unaltered following weeks/months of training. While the mechanisms facilitating PV expansion with ET have been previously reviewed extensively this is not the case for RBCV. Endurance champions may have 40% more RBCV than controls and RBCV may increase up to 10% following months of regular exercise training in healthy individuals. Such adaptations are the main factor leading to concomitant changes in maximal oxygen uptake. The increase in RBCV is preceded by that of PV after few ET sessions, which in turn transiently decreases the hematocrit. The “critmeter” theory suggests that O2 sensors located within the juxtamedullary apparatus regulate the hematocrit via modulation of renal erythropoietin (EPO) production according to arterial O2 content-dependent changes in tissue O2 pressure. Hence, the initial decrease in hematocrit can be considered as a primary mechanism facilitating RBCV expansion with ET. Furthermore, after a single endurance exercise bout blood volume-regulating hormones ANGII and VPN increase transiently. Both stimulate renal EPO production. Catecholamines and cortisol, stress hormones acutely increased by endurance exercise, may facilitate the release of red blood cells from the bone marrow, thus possibly contributing to ET-induced erythropoiesis. These and other endocrine effects could be enhanced by the hyperplasia of the hematopoietic bone marrow observed in endurance athletes.},

abstract = {Abstract: Acute breath-holding (apnoea) induces a spleen contraction leading to a transient increase in haemoglobin concentration. Additionally, the apnoea-induced hypoxia has been shown to lead to an increase in erythropoietin concentration up to 5 h after acute breath-holding, suggesting long-term haemoglobin enhancement. Given its potential to improve haemoglobin content, an important determinant for oxygen transport, apnoea has been suggested as a novel training method to improve aerobic performance. This review aims to provide an update on the current state of the literature on this topic. Although the apnoea-induced spleen contraction appears to be effective in improving oxygen uptake kinetics, this does not seem to transfer into immediately improved aerobic performance when apnoea is integrated into a warm-up. Furthermore, only long and intense apnoea protocols in individuals who are experienced in breath-holding show increased erythropoietin and reticulocytes. So far, studies on inexperienced individuals have failed to induce acute changes in erythropoietin concentration following apnoea. As such, apnoea training protocols fail to demonstrate longitudinal changes in haemoglobin mass and aerobic performance. The low hypoxic dose, as evidenced by minor oxygen desaturation, is likely insufficient to elicit a strong erythropoietic response. Apnoea therefore does not seem to be useful for improving aerobic performance. However, variations in apnoea, such as hypoventilation training at low lung volume and repeated-sprint training in hypoxia through short end-expiratory breath-holds, have been shown to induce metabolic adaptations and improve several physical qualities. This shows promise for application of dynamic apnoea in order to improve exercise performance. Highlights: What is the topic of this review? Apnoea is considered as an innovative method to improve performance. This review discusses the effectiveness of apnoea (training) on performance. What advances does it highlight? Although the apnoea-induced spleen contraction and the increase in EPO observed in freedivers seem promising to improve haematological variables both acutely and on the long term, they do not improve exercise performance in an athletic population. However, performing repeated sprints on end-expiratory breath-holds seems promising to improve repeated-sprint capacity.},

abstract = {Despite early and ongoing debate among athletes, coaches, and sport scientists, it is likely that resistance training for endurance cyclists can be tolerated, promotes desired adaptations that support training, and can directly improve performance. Lower-body heavy strength training performed in addition to endurance-cycling training can improve both short- And long-term endurance performance. Strength-maintenance training is essential to retain strength gains during the competition season. Competitive female cyclists with greater lower-body lean mass (LBLM) tend to have $\sim$4-9% higher maximum mean power per kg LBLM over 1 s to 10 min. Such relationships enable optimal body composition to be modeled. Resistance training off the bike may be particularly useful for modifying LBLM, whereas more cycling-specific training strategies like eccentric cycling and single-leg cycling with a counterweight have not been thoughtfully investigated in well-trained cyclists. Potential mechanisms for improved endurance include postponed activation of less efficient type II muscle fibers, conversion of type IIX fibers into more fatigueresistant IIa fibers, and increased muscle mass and rate of force development.},

Unfortunately, data about osmolality and pH are usually missing on the labels of commercially available sports drinks and are unknown in the case of homemade sports drinks. Therefore, we analy/ed the osmolality and pH of 35 sports and recovery drinks, as well as that of 53 other beverages usually consumed in Switzerland. The osmolality of the analyzed sports and recovery drinks varied over a relatively wide range (157-690 mmol/kg) with the homemade sports drinks being at the lower end and some commercial recovery drinks at the higher end. The osmolality of some commercial sports drinks, which are designed to be consumed during exercise, tended to be in the hypertonic range, although such drinks should rather be slightly hypotonic. The pH of nearly all analyzed sports drinks was in the range of about 3 to 4. which is of some concern because of the potential of low pH solutions to erode teeth. Although some of the tested sports drinks did not have an optimal osmolality. issues like individual tolerance and flavor preference of the drinks must also be considered before generally discouraging their consumption. Future generations of sports drinks should, however, also address the pH of the drinks to minimize their impact on dental erosion.},

abstract = {Background: Our scientific understanding of the mechanistic and practical connections between training session prescriptions, their execution by athletes, and adaptations over time in elite endurance sports remains limited. These connections are fundamental to the art and science of coaching. Objective: By using successful Norwegian endurance coaches as key informants, the aim of this study is to describe and compare best practice session models across different exercise intensities in Olympic endurance sports. Methods: Data collection was based on a four-step pragmatic qualitative study design, involving questionnaires, training logs from successful athletes, and in-depth and semi-structured interviews, followed by negotiation among researchers and coaches to assure our interpretations. Twelve successful and experienced male Norwegian coaches from biathlon, cross-country skiing, long-distance running, road cycling, rowing, speed skating, swimming, and triathlon were chosen as key informants. They had been responsible for the training of world-class endurance athletes who altogether have won > 370 medals in international championships. Results: The duration of low-intensity training (LIT) sessions ranges from 30 min to 7 h across sports, mainly due to modality-specific constraints and load tolerance considerations. Cross-training accounts for a considerable part of LIT sessions in several sports. Moderate (MIT)- and high-intensity training (HIT) sessions are mainly conducted as intervals in specific modalities, but competitions also account for a large proportion of annual HIT in most sports. Interval sessions are characterized by a high accumulated volume, a progressive increase in intensity throughout the session, and a controlled, rather than exhaustive, execution approach. A clear trend towards shorter intervals and lower work: rest ratio with increasing intensity was observed. Overall, the analyzed sports implement considerably more MIT than HIT sessions across the annual cycle. Conclusions: This study provides novel insights on quantitative and qualitative aspects of training session models across intensities employed by successful athletes in Olympic endurance sports. The interval training sessions revealed in this study are generally more voluminous, more controlled, and less exhaustive than most previous recommendations outlined in research literature.},

abstract = {The purpose of this current opinion paper is to describe the journey of ingested carbohydrate from ‘mouth to mitochondria' culminating in energy production in skeletal muscles during exercise. This journey is conveniently described as primary, secondary, and tertiary events. The primary stage is detection of ingested carbohydrate by receptors in the oral cavity and on the tongue that activate reward and other centers in the brain leading to insulin secretion. After digestion, the secondary stage is the transport of monosaccharides from the small intestine into the systemic circulation. The passage of these monosaccharides is facilitated by the presence of various transport proteins. The intestinal mucosa has carbohydrate sensors that stimulate the release of two ‘incretin' hormones (GIP and GLP-1) whose actions range from the secretion of insulin to appetite regulation. Most of the ingested carbohydrate is taken up by the liver resulting in a transient inhibition of hepatic glucose release in a dose-dependent manner. Nonetheless, the subsequent increased hepatic glucose (and lactate) output can increase exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates by 40–50%. The recognition and successful distribution of carbohydrate to the brain and skeletal muscles to maintain carbohydrate oxidation as well as prevent hypoglycaemia underpins the mechanisms to improve exercise performance.},

abstract = {In this review, we argue that several key features of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) should underpin discussions about the biological and reductionist determinants of its interindividual variability: (i) training-induced increases in VO2max are largely facilitated by expansion of red blood cell volume and an associated improvement in stroke volume, which also adapts independent of changes in red blood cell volume. These general concepts are also informed by cross-sectional studies in athletes that have very high values for VO2max. Therefore, (ii) variations in VO2max improvements with exercise training are also likely related to variations in these physiological determinants. (iii) All previously untrained individuals will respond to endurance exercise training in terms of improvements in VO2max provided the stimulus exceeds a certain volume and/or intensity. Thus, genetic analysis and/or reductionist studies performed to understand or predict such variations might focus specifically on DNA variants or other molecular phenomena of relevance to these physiological pathways.},

However, long-term studies and detailed investigations of macro, meso, and micro-periodization of HIT blocks in world-class endurance athletes are currently lacking. In a recent study, we showed that the world's most successful cross-country (XC) skier used two different periodization models with success throughout her career. One including extensive use of HIT blocks, namely BP, and one using a traditional method namely TRAD. In this study, we compare BP with TRAD in two comparable successful seasons and provide a detailed description of the annual use of HIT blocks in BP. The participant is the most-decorated winter Olympian, with 8 Olympic gold medals, 18 world championship titles, and 114 world cup victories. Training data was categorized by training form (endurance, strength, and speed), intensity [low (LIT), moderate (MIT), and HIT], and mode (running, cycling, and skiing/roller skiing). No significant difference was found in the total endurance training load between BP and TRAD. However, training volume in BP was lower compared to TRAD (15 ± 6 vs. 18 ± 7 h/wk, P = 0.001), mainly explained by less LIT (13 ± 5 vs. 15 ± 5 h/wk, P = 0.004). Lower volume of MIT was also performed in BP compared to TRAD (13 vs. 38 sessions/year), whereas the amount of HIT was higher in BP (157 vs. 77 sessions/year). While BP included high amounts of HIT already from the first preparation period, followed by a reduction toward the competition period, TRAD had a progressive increase in HIT toward the competition period. In BP, the athlete performed seven HIT blocks, varying from 7 to 11 days, each including 8-13 HIT sessions. This study provides novel insights into successful utilization of two different periodization models in the worlds best XC skier, and illustrates the macro, meso and micro- periodization of HIT blocks to increase the overall amount of HIT.},

Objective To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to evaluate the effect BP of endurance training on endurance performance and factors determinative for endurance performance in trained- to well-trained athletes. Methods The PubMed, SPORTdiscus and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to August 2019. Studies were included if the following criteria were met: 1) the study examined a block-periodized endurance training intervention; 2) the study had a one-, two or multiple group-, crossover- or case-study design; 3) the study assessed at least one key endurance variable before and after the intervention period. A total of 2905 studies were screened, where 20 records met the eligibility criteria. Methodological quality for each study was assessed using the PEDro scale. Six studies were pooled to perform meta-analysis for maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and maximal power output (Wmax) during an incremental exercise test to exhaustion. Due to a lower number of studies and heterogenous measurements, other performance measures were systematically reviewed. Results The meta-analyses revealed small favorable effects for BP compared to TRAD regarding changes in VO2max (standardized mean difference, 0.40; 95% CI=0.02, 0.79) and Wmax (standardized mean difference, 0.28; 95% CI=0.01, 0.54). For changes in endurance performance and workload at different exercise thresholds BP generally revealed moderate- to large-effect sizes compared to TRAD. Conclusion BP is an adequate, alternative training strategy to TRAD as evidenced by superior training effects on VO2max and Wmax in athletes. The reviewed studies show promising effects for BP of endurance training; however, these results must be considered with some caution due to small studies with generally low methodological quality (mean PEDro score =3.7/10).},

abstract = {Sodium bicarbonate is used as an ergogenic supplement to enhance people's performances in various exercises. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of intestinal delivery of sodium bicarbonate on bicarbonate absorption and associated side effects in an experimental human trial. After preparing and assessing enteric-coated and uncoated sodium bicarbonate tablet formulations, pharmacokinetic analysis and gastrointestinal symptom tests were performed after oral administration in the human body. The dose required to increase blood bicarbonate concentration over 5 mmol∙L−1 for the purpose of improving performance during high-intensity exercise was also determined. Enteric-coated tablet formulation protects sodium bicarbonate under acidic conditions and releases bicarbonate in the intestine. Enteric-coated tablet formulation also reduced the oral dose required to achieve a blood bicarbonate concentration over 5 mmol∙L−1 from 300 mg∙kg−1 of uncoated tablet formulation to 225 mg∙kg−1. Gastrointestinal discomfort was significantly decreased for the group given 225 mg∙kg−1 enteric-coated tablets compared to that given 300 mg∙kg−1 uncoated tablets. These results suggest that enteric-coated tablet formulation could reduce the oral dose required in order to achieve a blood bicarbonate concentration over 5 mmol∙L−1 by 25%, from 300 mg∙kg−1 to 225 mg∙kg−1, along with its ability to reduce gastrointestinal discomfort associated with the dosage.},

abstract = {Purpose: To compare training characteristics and aerobic power (VO2max) between the most successful junior and senior seasons of world-class cross-country (XC) skiers and to identify differences between sexes and among sprint and distance skiers. Methods: Retrospective analysis was conducted on self-reported training and VO2max tests of ten male and seven female world-class XC-skiers, collectively holding 38 Olympic medals. Training was categorized by form (endurance, strength, speed, other) and mode (specific, unspecific) and was divided into low- (LIT), moderate- (MIT), and high-intensity training (HIT). Results: Total training increased by 203 ± 130 h (35% ± 31%, p <.001, large effect) and 78 ± 69 sessions (21% ± 24%, p <.001, very large effect). Junior training volume (658 ± 107 h) did not correlate with senior volume (861 ± 74 h) but correlated negatively with changes in volume (r = −.822, p <.001). No sex differences were observed related to total volume, but distance skiers increased their total volume more than sprint skiers (p =.037, large effect). Endurance training increased by 197 ± 117 h (p <.001; large effect) tied to increased low-intensity training (186 ± 115 h, p <.001; large effect) and moderate-intensity training (13 ± 7 h, p <.001; large effect). Training intensity distribution (% LIT/MIT/HIT) was 91/3/6 in junior and 92/4/4 in senior season. Women demonstrated greater increase of unspecific modes (100 ± 58 vs. 37 ± 44 h, p =.022; large effect) and strength training (25 ± 23 vs. −3 ± 17 h, p =.010, large effect). Men improved absolute (8% ± 5%; p =.009; large effect) and relative VO2max (6% ± 4%; p =.016; large effect) from junior to senior, while women only increased relative VO2max (7% ± 5%, p =.012; large effect). Conclusion: This study provides novel information regarding changes in training characteristics and aerobic power from junior to senior age in world-class XC-skiers. Overall, the enhanced training volume during this transition was primarily driven by increased LIT and MIT and the exceptionally high relative VO2max at junior age further increased in both sexes.},

abstract = {The fact that road cycling is an endurance sport is generally not up for discussion. However, new research on endurance provides food for thought. Are we looking at the right parameters to assess the performance level of a road cyclist? Are we selecting young talents the right way? And, are we, as trainer/coaches, emphasizing the right things in their training? _________________ Marco van Bon Road cycling races are decided during so-called critical periods. 1,2 These are periods during a race when riders really need to unleash their power in order to force the course of the race into a personal advantage. 1 Critical periods are therefore also called 'race-winning efforts'. 3 An example of a critical period is when a rider attacks and tries to break-away from a group, or tries to close the gap towards the group in front of him. Periods in which a cyclist is hammering at the front of the leading group in order to stay away, or an explosive final sprint at the finish line, can also be considered as critical periods. Critical periods are race-specific and determined by the course (gradient, cobbled sections, etc.), conditions (wind, altitude, temperature, etc.), the length of the race and race tactics. Based on specific race situations and the energy systems that are utilized during these situations, we can roughly divide these critical periods into three time spans: short (between 5 and 60 seconds), medium (from 1 minute to 10 minutes), and long critical periods (from 10 minutes onwards). 1 These periods typically occur several times during a race and may not directly lead to the decisive move. Although critical moments also occur in the beginning or halfway through a race and may determine the outcome of a race, the real 'race-winning efforts' are generally made in the final stage ('final') of a race. At that point of the race, professional cyclists have been riding for more than four hours meaning that decisive efforts are often made at moments when fatigue comes into play. 4 Durability or fatigue resistance Since 2021, the importance of fatigue in road cycling has grabbed the attention of researchers, as reflected in the massive increase in number of articles on this topic in sports science literature. In their influential paper about fatigue, Ed Maunder and Stephen Seiler (the man behind polarized training) where the first to introduce the term durability. 5 They describe durability as the ability to resist the influence of fatigue.},

abstract = {Durability and repeatability (i.e. the ability to sustain high power output values under fatigue and to endure repeated high-intensity efforts, respectively) are emerging as cycling performance determinants. We aimed to analyze whether these markers differ between professional cyclists of two competition levels (WorldTour [WT] and Proteam [PT]) during a Grand Tour. We studied 8 WT and 7 PT cyclists who competed in “La Vuelta 2020”. Durability was assessed with the mean maximal power (MMP) values attained between 5 sec–30 min after different levels of mechanical work done (0–35 kJ{\textperiodcentered}kg−1). Repeatability was assessed as the ability to repeat efforts >95% MMP. Although no differences were found for durability during the whole race (p = 0.209), a significant interaction effect was found in separate analyses by week (p = 0.011). Thus, during the first week and in the “fresh” state (0 kJ{\textperiodcentered}kg−1), WT cyclists solely attained significantly higher MMP values for 30-min efforts. However, these differences enlarged with accumulating levels of fatigue (e.g. significantly higher MMP values in WT cyclists for 30-sec, 1-min, 5-min, 20-min and 30-min efforts after 35 kJ{\textperiodcentered}kg−1). On the other hand, no between-group differences were found in repeatability for the whole race (p = 0.777) or in separate analyses by week (p = 0.808). In summary, the present results support the role of durability (but not of repeatability) as a performance indicator during professional cycling races. Highlights The present study suggests that cyclists from different professional team categories (WorldTour [WT] or ProTeam [PT]) show comparable mean maximal power (MMP) values during a Grand Tour when fatigue is not considered. However, WT cyclists seem to attain greater MMP values than PT ones as the race progresses (from the first to the third week) and with accumulating levels of work done (from 0 to 35 kJ{\textperiodcentered}kg−1) during a given stage. In turn, no differences were found between WT and PT cyclists in the number of high-intensity efforts (>95% of their individual MMP) performed during the race. These findings would highlight the role of durability (the ability to attenuate fatigue-induced decline in performance during prolonged exercise) as a determining factor of cycling performance.},

Average weekly training volume and frequency, hours at different intensities (zones 1-3), cross-training, running, orienteering, interval training, continuous training, and competition were calculated. Training volume was higher in GPP than TP, SPP, and CP (14.9 vs 9.7, 11.5, and 10.6 h/wk, P < .05). Training frequency was higher in GPP than TP (10 vs 7.5 sessions/wk, P < .05). Zone 1 training was higher in GPP than TP, SPP, and CP (11.3 vs 7.1, 8.3, and 7.7 h/wk, P < .05). Zone 3 training was higher in SPP and CP than in TP and GPP (0.9 and 1.1 vs 1.6 and 1.5 h/ wk, P < .05). Cross-training was higher in GPP than SPP and CP (4.3 vs 0.8 h/wk, P < .05). Interval training was higher in GPP than TP, SPP, and CP (0.7 vs 0.3 h/wk, P < .05). High-intensity continuous training was higher in GPP than CP (0.9 vs 0.4 h/ wk, P < .05), while competition was higher in SPP and CP than in TP and GPP (1.3 and 1.5 vs 0.6 and 0.3 h/wk, P < .01). In conclusion, these champion endurance athletes achieved a progressive reduction in total training volume from GPP to CP via a shortening of each individual session while the number of training sessions remained unchanged. This decrease in training volume was primarily due to a reduction in the number of hours of low-intensity, non-sport-specific cross-training.},

abstract = {Block periodized (BP) training is an innovative and prospective approach that is drawing increasing attention from coaching scientists and practitioners. However, its further dissemination and implementation demands serious scientific biological underpinnings. More specifically, the fundamental scientific concepts of homeostatic regulation, stress adaptation and the law of supercompensation determine the biological essence and content of appropriate block mesocycles, i.e., the accumulation, transmutation and realization cycles, respectively. Such a separation is intended to prevent conflicting physiological responses and provide a favorable interaction for training effects. Several studies have evaluated the metabolic effects of various training programs, and the superiority of the BP model has been confirmed in terms of significant gains of maximal oxygen uptake, maximal power output and positive trends in athletic performance. It was found that the endocrine status of athletes is strictly dependent on appropriate blocks such as voluminous extensive workloads combined with resistance training (accumulation), lower-volume intense training (transmutation), and event-specific precompetitive training (realization). Evidence from molecular biology indicates the major regulators that determine meaningful adaptive events within specific block mesocycles. Specifically, voluminous extensive accumulation blocks stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and protein synthesis in slow-twitch muscle fibres, whereas lower-volume intense workloads of the transmutation blocks evoke adaptive modifications in fast-twitch glycolytic and oxidative-glycolytic muscle fibers. Furthermore, such a training program causes a remarkable elevation of myonuclear content in muscle fibers that enables athletes to regain previously acquired abilities. The precompetitive realization block produces accentuated expression of stress-related and myogenic genes that affect protein synthesis and increase muscle glycogen. In addition, such a program stimulates and increases the size, force and power of fast-twitch fibers.},

Men had significantly (P < 0.001) more SM in comparison to women in both absolute terms (33.0 vs. 21.0 kg) and relative to body mass (38.4 vs. 30.6%). The gender differences were greater in the upper (40%) than lower (33%) body (P < 0.01). We observed a reduction in relative SM mass starting in the third decade; however, a noticeable decrease in absolute SM mass was not observed until the end of the fifth decade. This decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease in lower body SM. Weight and height explained $\sim$50% of the variance in SM mass in men and women. Although a linear relationship existed between SM and height, the relationship between SM and body weight was curvilinear because the contribution of SM to weight gain decreased with increasing body weight. These findings indicate that men have more SM than women and that these gender differences are greater in the upper body. Independent of gender, aging is associated with a decrease in SM mass that is explained, in large measure, by a decrease in lower body SM occurring after the fifth decade.},

Yet, no study has, to date, measured the % of VO2max during all interval sessions throughout a prolonged training intervention and subsequently related it to the magnitude of training adaptations. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the relationship between % of VO2max achieved during an interval training intervention and changes in endurance performance and its physiological determinants in well-trained cyclists. Twenty-two cyclists (VO2max 67.1 (6.4) mL{\textperiodcentered}min−1 {\textperiodcentered}kg−1; males, n = 19; females, n = 3) underwent a 9-week interval training intervention, consisting 21 sessions of 5 × 8-min intervals conducted at their 40-min highest sustainable mean power output (PO). Oxygen uptake was measured during all interval sessions, and the relationship between % of VO2max during work intervals and training adaptations were investigated using linear regression. A performance index was calculated from several performance measures. With higher % of VO2max during work intervals, greater improvements were observed for maximal PO during the VO2max test (R2adjusted = 0.44, p = 0.009), PO at 4 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L−1 [blood lactate] (R2adjusted = 0.25, p = 0.035), the performance index (R2adjusted = 0.36, p = 0.013), and VO2max (R2adjusted = 0.54, p = 0.029). Other measures, such as % of maximal heart rate, were related to fewer outcome variables and exhibited poorer session-to-session repeatability compared to % of VO2max. In conclusion, improvements in endurance measures were positively related to the % of VO2max achieved during interval training. Percentage of VO2max was the measure that best reflected the magnitude of training adaptations.},

abstract = {Objectives: Although the ability to attenuate power output (PO) declines after accumulated work (i.e., ‘durability') is increasingly recognized as a major determinant of cycling performance, the potential role of the intensity of the previous work is unclear. We assessed the effect of work-matched levels of accumulated work at different intensities on performance in male professional cyclists. Design: Observational field-based study. Methods: PO data was registered in 17 cyclists during a competition season, and the critical power (CP) was repeatedly determined every 4 weeks from training sessions and competitions. Participants' maximum mean power (MMP) for different durations (5 s, 5 min, 10 min, and 20 min) and the CP were determined under ‘fresh' conditions (0 kJ{\textperiodcentered}kg−1) and after varying levels of accumulated work (2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 kJ{\textperiodcentered}kg−1) at intensities below and above the CP. Results: A significant decline was found for all MMP values following all levels of accumulated work above the CP (− 4.0 %, − 1.7 %, − 1.8 %, and − 3.2 % for 30s, 5 min, 10 min and 20 min-MMP, respectively; all p < 0.001), versus no change after any level of accumulated work below the CP (all p > 0.05). Similar results were observed for the CP, which decreased after all levels of accumulated work above (− 2.2 %, − 6.1 %, and − 16.2 %, after 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 kJ{\textperiodcentered}kg−1, p < 0.001) but not below this indicator (p > 0.05). Conclusions: In male professional cyclists, accumulated work above the CP impairs performance compared with work-matched, albeit less intense efforts. This raises concerns on the use of mechanical work per se as a single fatigue/stress indicator in these athletes.},

Self-reported session-by-session training data from 17 (7 female) world-class cross-country skiers were retrospectively analyzed. The data were separated into general preparation (GP) and competition periods (CP), during which all skiers achieved world-class performance. Daily training volume was categorized as very low (0%–50% of mean daily volume), low (50%–100%), moderate (100%–150%), and high (≥ 150%). Training load (Training Impulse, TRIMP) was calculated as the product of duration and an intensity factor of 1, 2, or 3 for low-, moderate-, and high-intensity training, respectively. Training volume was distributed as 18%/22%/32%/28% across very low/low/moderate/high volume days during GP, whereas the corresponding distribution during CP was 23%/35%/32%/10%. Shifts in daily TRIMP from GP to CP mirrored changes in training volume. During GP, the acute-to-chronic work ratio (ACWR) was 0.75–1.25 on 69% of the days, with 13% of the days showing lower ratios and 18% higher. During CP, the corresponding values were 69%/19%/12%.

Training volumes on the day before intensive sessions were 127 ± 13% (GP) and 99 ± 7% (CP) of the daily mean, whereas the corresponding values for the days after were 116 ± 8% and 87 ± 9%. These data provide new insights into day-to-day periodization in world-class cross-country skiers, highlighting the sequential application of training loads by alternating training days of high volume, elevated intensity every 3–4 days, or reduced training load or rest every 8–9 days, while only 5% combining volume and intensity.},

abstract = {Introduction: Sex-specific differences that arise during puberty have a pronounced effect on the training process. However, the consequences this should have for goal-setting, planning and implementation of training for boys and girls of different ages remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to quantify performance developments in athletic running and jumping disciplines in the age range 11-18 and identify progression differences as a function of age, discipline and sex. Methods: The 100 all-time best Norwegian male and female 60-m, 800-m, long jump and high jump athletes in each age category from 11 to 18 years were analysed using mixed models with random intercept according to athlete. Results: Male and female athletes perform almost equally in running and jumping events up to the age of 12. Beyond this age, males outperform females. Relative annual performance development in females gradually decreases throughout the analyzed age period. In males, annual relative performance development accelerates up to the age of 13 (for running events) or 14 (for jumping events) and then gradually declines when approaching 18 years of age. The relative improvement from age 11 to 18 was twice as high in jumping events compared to running events. For all of the analyzed disciplines, overall improvement rates were >50% higher for males than for females. The performance sex difference evolves from <5% to 10-18% in all the analyzed disciplines from age 11 to 18 yr. Conclusion: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to present absolute and relative annual performance developments in running and jumping events for competitive athletes from early to late adolescence. These results allow coaches and athletes to set realistic goals and prescribe conditioning programs that take into account sex-specific differences in the rate of performance development at different stages of maturation.},

In this study, the fatigue power profiles of male and female professional cyclists were characterized and a novel optimal pacing strategy model was established to determine the output power distribution based on the simulated annealing algorithm. Moreover, the model was implemented on the male 2021 UCI ITT course and the female 2021 Olympic ITT course. Compared with the actual performance of the professional cyclists, the race scores predicted by this model are among the best, which indicates that the model is highly practical and instructive. Considering riders are unlikely to follow the detailed plan exactly and their output power can deviate from the optimal power, a sensitivity analysis was conducted and the results demonstrated the high stability and reliability of the model.},

abstract = {The 'cycling hour-record' is one of the most prestigious events in cycling.  However, little detailed analysis of such attempts is available. In preparation for a successful cycling hour-record attempt, an elite cyclist performed a full-hour simulation to provide insights into performance, physiological, aerodynamic and biomechanical limitations that could be identified in the preparation for a subsequent official attempt. Performance (speed, lap time, power and cadence), physiological (heart rate and estimated body temperature), aerodynamic (C(D)A, helmet angle, rotation and rock) and biomechanical (helmet, thigh and foot position changes) measurements were made throughout the attempt, in which an even-pacing strategy was employed where the point of task failure was defined as the lap which the rider could no longer perform at the targeted lap split (16.6 s) or quicker. The cyclist did not achieve the target distance (54,000 m) during the simulation. The final distance achieved for the hour was 53,250 m. Task failure occurred at 38 min and 33 s (lap 139/34,750 m) into the simulation. Notably, there was a decrease in power output, accompanied with an increase in the estimated body temperature, changes in pedalling kinematics and an increase in aerodynamic drag. The reduction in performance (leading to task failure) during a cycling hour record simulation is underpinned by a decrease in power output as well as an increase in aerodynamic drag due to biomechanical changes in the cycling technique.},

abstract = {Monod and Scherrer (1965) showed that there was a linear relation between the maximal work and the maximal time over which the work was performed until the onset of local muscular exhaustion. This linear relation could be expressed by the equation: Wlim = a +b Wlim where maximal work (Wlim) was thought to result from the use of an energy reserve (a) and an energy reconstitution whose maximal rate was (b). We have extended this concept to total body work (bicycle ergometer). Eight male and eight female college students underwent exercise tests at 400, 350, 300, 275 and 300, 250, 200, 175 W respectively, to Ihe onset of fatigue. The regression analysis revealed that the linearity of individual plots was found to be 0-982 <R2< 0998 (p<0-01). Experimental results indicated that the maximal energy reconstitution rate (h) was correlated with the onset of anaerobic threshold (AT) as determined by the gas exchange method (r=0-928, p<OOl). Furthermore, the sum of (a) and (b) (energy reserve and maximal rate of energy reconstitution) was found to be highly correlated with V02 max (r=0956, p< 0-001) and the regression equation: V02 max (l/min)=000795 x [a + b] + 0.114 could be used to predict V02 max with a SEE of 0241/min. {\textcopyright} 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Efforts to understand human physiology through the study of champion athletes and  record performances have been ongoing for about a century. For endurance sports three main factors--maximal oxygen consumption (.VO(2,max)), the so-called 'lactate threshold' and efficiency (i.e. the oxygen cost to generate a given running speed or cycling power output)--appear to play key roles in endurance performance. and lactate threshold interact to determine the 'performance .VO(2)' which is the oxygen consumption that can be sustained for a given period of time. Efficiency interacts with the performance .VO(2) to establish the speed or power that can be generated at this oxygen consumption. This review focuses on what is currently known about how these factors interact, their utility as predictors of elite performance, and areas where there is relatively less information to guide current thinking. In this context, definitive ideas about the physiological determinants of running and cycling efficiency is relatively lacking in comparison with .VO(2,max) and the lactate threshold, and there is surprisingly limited and clear information about the genetic factors that might pre-dispose for elite performance. It should also be cautioned that complex motivational and sociological factors also play important roles in who does or does not become a champion and these factors go far beyond simple physiological explanations. Therefore, the performance of elite athletes is likely to defy the types of easy explanations sought by scientific reductionism and remain an important puzzle for those interested in physiological integration well into the future.},

abstract = {Previous studies in endurance athletes have indicated that block periodization (BP) can be a good alternative to the more traditional organization of training despite the fact that the total volume and intensity of the training are similar. However, these studies usually last only 4-12 wk. The aim of the present single-case study was to investigate the consequences of 58 wk with systematic BP of low-intensity training (LIT), moderate-intensity training (MIT), and high-intensity interval training (HIT) including incorporation of heavy strength training. It is important that a maintenance stimulus on the nonprioritized training modalities was added in the different training blocks. Performance-related variables were tested regularly during the intervention. The studied cyclist started with a maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) of 73.8 mL kg-1 min-1, peak aerobic power (Wmax) of 6.14 W/kg, and a power output at 3 mmol/L blood lactate concentration (Power3la-) of 3.6 W/kg. Total training volume during the 58-wk intervention was 678 h, of which 452 h were LIT (67%), 124 h were MIT (18%), 69 h were HIT (10%), and 34 h were heavy strength training (5%). The weekly training volume had a large range depending on the focus of the training block. After the intervention the cyclist's VO2max was 87 mL kg-1 min-1, Wmax was 7.35 W/kg, and Power3la- was 4.9 W/kg. This single case indicates that the present training program can be a good alternative to the more traditional organization of long-term training of endurance athletes. However, a general recommendation cannot be given based on this single-case study.},

abstract = {Maximal oxygen uptake V̇O2 is a physiological characteristic bounded by the parametric limits of the Fick equation: (left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume - LV end-systolic volume) × heart rate × arterio-venous oxygen difference. 'Classical' views of V̇O2 emphasize its critical dependence on convective oxygen transport to working skeletal muscle, and recent data are dispositive, proving convincingly that such limits must and do exist. 'Contemporary' investigations into the mechanisms underlying peripheral muscle fatigue due to energetic supply/demand mismatch are clarifying the local mediators of fatigue at the skeletal muscle level, though the afferent signalling pathways that communicate these environmental conditions to the brain and the sites of central integration of cardiovascular and neuromotor control are still being worked out. Elite endurance athletes have a high V̇O2 due primarily to a high cardiac output from a large compliant cardiac chamber (including the myocardium and pericardium) which relaxes quickly and fills to a large end-diastolic volume. This large capacity for LV filling and ejection allows preservation of blood pressure during extraordinary rates of muscle blood flow and oxygen transport which support high rates of sustained oxidative metabolism. The magnitude and mechanisms of cardiac phenotype plasticity remain uncertain and probably involve underlying genetic factors, as well as the length, duration, type, intensity and age of initiation of the training stimulus. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Endurance athletes tend to accumulate large training volumes, the majority of which are performed at a low intensity and a smaller portion at moderate and high intensity. However, different training intensity distributions (TID) are employed to maximize physiological and performance adaptations. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and network meta-analysis of individual participant data to compare the effect of different TID models on maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and time-trial (TT) performance in endurance-trained athletes. METHODS Studies were included if: (1) they were published in peer reviewed academic journals, (2) they were in English, (3) they were experimental or quasi-experimental studies, (4) they included trained endurance athletes, (5) they compared a polarized (POL) TID intervention to a comparator group that utilized a different TID model, (6) the duration in each intensity domain could be quantified, and (7) they reported VO2max or TT performance. Medline and SPORTDiscus were searched from inception until 11 February 2024. RESULTS We included 13 studies with 348 (n = 296 male, n = 52 female) recreational (n = 150) and competitive (n = 198) endurance athletes. Mean age ranged from 17.6 to 41.5 years and VO2max ranged from 46.6 to 68.3 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1, across studies respectively. Based on the time in heart rate zone approach, there was no difference in VO2max (SMD = - 0.06, p = 0.68) or TT performance (SMD = - 0.05, p = 0.34) between POL and pyramidal (PYR) interventions. There were no statistically significant differences between POL and any of the other TID interventions. Subgroup analysis showed a statistically significant difference in the response of VO2max between recreational and competitive athletes for POL and PYR (SMD = - 0.63, p < 0.05). Competitive athletes may have greater improvements to VO2max with POL, while recreational athletes may improve more with a PYR TID. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that the adaptations to VO2max following different TID interventions are dependent on performance level. Athletes at a more competitive level may benefit from a POL TID intervention and recreational athletes from a PYR TID intervention.},

abstract = {The aims of the present study were to determine test-retest reliability for unilateral strength and power tests used to quantify asymmetry and determine the consistency of both the magnitude and direction of asymmetry between test sessions. Twenty-eight recreational trained sport athletes performed unilateral isometric squat, countermovement jump (CMJ) and drop jump (DJ) tests over two test sessions. Inter-limb asymmetry was calculated from both the best trial and as an average of three trials for each test. Test reliability was computed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV) and standard error of measurement (SEM). In addition, paired samples t-tests were used to determine systematic bias between test sessions and Kappa coefficients to report how consistently asymmetry favoured the same side. Within and between-session reliability ranged from moderate to excellent (ICC range = 0.70–0.96) and CV values ranged from 3.7–13.7% across tests. Significant differences in asymmetry between test sessions were seen for impulse during the isometric squat (p = 0.04; effect size = –0.60) but only when calculating from the best trial. When computing the direction of asymmetry across test sessions, levels of agreement were fair to substantial for the isometric squat (Kappa = 0.29–0.64), substantial for the CMJ (Kappa = 0.64–0.66) and fair to moderate for the DJ (Kappa = 0.36–0.56). These results show that when asymmetry is computed between test sessions, the group mean is generally devoid of systematic bias; however, the direction of asymmetry shows greater variability and is often inter-changeable. Thus, practitioners should consider both the direction and magnitude of asymmetry when monitoring inter-limb differences in healthy athlete populations.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the training characteristics of an elite team pursuit cycling squad in the 3-month preparation phases prior to 2 successive world-record (WR) performances. METHODS: Training data of 5 male track endurance cyclists (mean [SD]; age 23.4 [3.46] y; body mass 80.2 [2.74] kg; 4.5 [0.17] W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 at LT2; maximal aerobic power 6.2 [0.27] W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1; maximal oxygen uptake 65.9 [2.89] mL{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1) were analyzed with weekly total training volume by training type and heart rate, power output, and torque intensity distributions calculated with reference to the respective WRs' performance requirements. RESULTS: Athletes completed 805 (82.81) and 725 (68.40) min{\textperiodcentered}wk-1 of training, respectively, in each season. In the second season, there was a 32% increase in total track volume, although track sessions were shorter (ie, greater frequency) in the second season. A pyramidal intensity distribution was consistent across both seasons, with 81% of training, on average, performed below LT1 power output each week, whereas 6% of training was performed above LT2. Athletes accumulated greater volume above WR team pursuit lead power (2.4% vs 0.9%) and torque (6.2% vs 3.2%) in 2019. In one athlete, mean single-leg-press peak rate of force development was 71% and 46% higher at mid- and late-phases, respectively, during the preparation period. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide novel insights into the common and contrasting methods contributing to successive WR team pursuit performances. Greater accumulation of volume above race-specific power and torque (eg, team pursuit lead), as well as improved neuromuscular force-generating capacities, may be worthy of investigation for implementation in training programs.},

To establish the time-course for physiological adaptations and performance effects, 20 male elite cyclists were divided into an intervention group (HEAT; n = 10) completing 5 weeks of HA (six one-hour HA-training sessions per week) and control (n = 10) tested pre and post in hot (40°C) and cool conditions (20°C). HEAT completed tests at 40°C every week during HA with measures of sweat rate and [Na+] and a decay test 2 weeks after termination of HA. HEAT improved time for exhaustion by 15 min (p < 0.001) in the 40°C test, increased sweat rate by 0.44 L/hour (p < 0.001), and lowered sweat sodium concentration [Na+] by 14.1 mmol/L (p = 0.006) from pre- to post-HA, with performance returning to pre-HA levels in the 2-week decay test. Total hemoglobin mass (tHbmass) was increased by 30 grams (+3%, p = 0.048) after 3 weeks and 40 grams (+4%, p = 0.038) after 5 weeks in HEAT but returned to pre-HA levels at the 2-week decay test. HEAT improved incremental peak power output (+12 W, p = 0.001) without significant changes in maximal oxygen uptake (p = 0.094). In conclusion, improvements in heat exercise tolerance and sudomotor adaptations materialized during the first $\sim$3 weeks and the entire 5 weeks of HA augmented both cool exercise capacity and tHbmass. However, the 2-week post-HA evaluation demonstrated a rapid decay of physiological adaptations and exercise capacity in the heat.},

CP was determined using a time-trial (TT) protocol of three durations (12, 7, and 3 min) interspersed by 30 min passive rest. FTP was calculated as 95% of 20-min mean power achieved during the TT. Differences between means were examined using magnitude-based inferences and a paired-samples t-test. Effect sizes are reported as Cohen's d. Agreement between CP and FTP was assessed using the 95% limits of agreement (LoA) method and Pearson correlation coefficient. There was a 91.7% probability that CP (256 ± 50 W) was higher than FTP (249 ± 44 W). Indeed, CP was significantly higher compared to FTP (P = 0.041) which was associated with a trivial effect size (d = 0.04). The mean bias between CP and FTP was 7 ± 13 W and LoA were −19 to 33 W. Even though strong correlations exist between CP and FTP (r = 0.969; P < 0.001), the chance of meaningful differences in terms of performance (1% smallest worthwhile change), were greater than 90%. With relatively large ranges for LoA between variables, these values generally should not be used interchangeably. Caution should consequently be exercised when choosing between FTP and CP for the purposes of performance analysis.},

This study aimed to investigate the natural variability of hematological ABP parameters over 1 year in elite athletes compared with healthy control subjects and the validity of a multiparametric model estimating plasma volume (PV) shifts to correct individual ABP thresholds. Blood samples were collected monthly with full blood counts performed by flow cytometry (Sysmex XN analyzers) in 20 elite xc-skiers (ELITE) and 20 moderately trained controls. Individual ABP profiles were generated through Anti-Doping Administration & Management System Training, a standalone version of the ABP's adaptive model developed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Additionally, eight serum parameters were computed as volume-sensitive biomarkers to run a multiparametric model to estimate PV. Variability in ELITE compared with controls was significantly higher for the Abnormal Blood Profile Scores (P = 0.003). Among 12 Atypical Passport Findings (ATPF) initially reported, six could be removed after correction of PV shifts with the multiparametric modeling. However, several ATPF were additionally generated (n = 19). Our study outlines a larger intraindividual variability in elite athletes, likely explained by more frequent exposure to extrinsic factors altering hematological biomarkers. PV correction for individual ABP thresholds allowed to explain most of the atypical findings while generating multiple new ATPF occurrences in the elite population. Overall, accounting for PV shifts in elite athletes was shown to be paramount in this study outlining the opportunity to consider PV variations with novel approaches when interpreting individual ABP profiles.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To profile the training characteristics of an elite team pursuit cycling squad and assess variations in training intensity and load accumulation across the 36-week period prior to a world-record performance at the 2018 Commonwealth Games. METHODS: Training data of 5 male track endurance cyclists (mean [SD]; age 21.9 [3.52] y; 4.4 [0.16] W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 at anaerobic threshold; 6.2 [0.28] W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 maximal oxygen uptake 68.7 [2.99] mL kg{\textperiodcentered}min-1) were analyzed with weekly total training volume and heart rate, power output, and torque intensity distributions calculated with reference to their 3:49.804 min:s.ms performance requirements for a 4-km team pursuit. RESULTS: Athletes completed 543 (37) h-1 of training across 436 (16) sessions. On-bike activities accounted for 69.9% of all training sessions, with participants cycling 11,246 (1139) km-1 in the training period of interest, whereas 12.7% of sessions involved gym/strength training. A pyramidal intensity distribution was evident with over 65% and 70% of training, respectively, performed at low-intensity zone heart rate and power output, whereas 5.3% and 7.7% of training was performed above anaerobic threshold. The athletes accumulated 4.4% of total training volume at, or above, their world-record team pursuit lead position torque (55 N{\textperiodcentered}m). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide updated and novel insight to the power and torque demands and load accumulation contributing to world-record team pursuit performance. Although the observed pyramidal intensity distribution is common in endurance sports, the lack of shift toward a polarized intensity distribution during taper and competition peaking differs from previous research.},

Nine healthy, untrained volunteers (age = 27 ± 4 yr) underwent supervised ET consisting of 3–4 × 60 min cycle ergometry sessions per week for 8 wk. Plasma volume (PV), RBCV, and overnight fasting hematological markers were determined before and at weeks 2, 4, and 8 of ET. In addition, plasma erythropoietin (EPO), cortisol, copeptin, and proatrial natriuretic peptide concentrations were measured during a 3-h morning period at baseline and postexercise at weeks 1 and 8. PV increased from baseline (2,405 ± 335 ml) at weeks 2, 4, and 8 (+374 ± 194, +505 ± 156, and +341 ± 160 ml, respectively, P 0.001). Increases in RBCV from baseline (1,737 ± 442 ml) were manifested at week 4 (+109 ± 114 ml, P = 0.030) and week 8 (+205 ± 109 ml, P = 0.001). Overnight fasting plasma EPO concentration increased from baseline (11.3 ± 4.8 mIU/ml) at week 2 (+2.5 ± 2.8 mIU{\textperiodcentered}ml-1, P = 0.027) and returned to baseline concentration at weeks 4 and 8. Higher 3-h-postexercise EPO concentration was observed at week 1 (11.6 mIU/ml) compared with week 8 (8.4 ± 3.9 mIU/ml, P = 0.009) and baseline (9.0 ± 4.2 mIU/ml, P 0.019). Linear relationships between EPO concentration and hematocrit ($\beta$-56.2, P 0.001) and cortisol ($\beta$ = 0.037, P 0.001) were detected throughout the ET intervention. In conclusion, ET leads to mild, transient increases in circulating EPO concentration, concurring with early PV expansion and lowered hematocrit, preceding gradual RBCV enhancement.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present review summarized evidence on the role of carbohydrates in recovery from exercise within the context of acute and chronic effects on metabolism and performance. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies demonstrate that, in contrast to recovery of muscle glycogen stores, the recovery of liver glycogen stores can be accelerated by the co-ingestion of fructose with glucose-based carbohydrates. Three recent studies suggest this can extend time-to-exhaustion during endurance exercise tests. However, periodically restricting carbohydrate intakes during recovery from some training sessions to slow the recovery of liver and muscle glycogen stores may, over time, result in a modest increase in the ability to oxidize fat during exercise in a fasted state. Whether this periodized strategy translates into a performance advantage in the fed state remains to be clearly demonstrated. SUMMARY: To maximize recovery of glycogen stores and the capacity to perform in subsequent endurance exercise, athletes should consider ingesting at least 1.2 g carbohydrate per kilogram body mass per hour - for the first few hours of recovery - as a mixture of fructose and glucose-based carbohydrates. However, if a goal is increased capacity for fat oxidation, athletes should consider restricting carbohydrate intakes during recovery from some key training sessions.

abstract = {Research on world-class athletes in endurance events, such as cycling Grand  Tours, has reported extreme levels of total energy expenditure. However, it has been argued that over extended periods, such as months, sustained energy expenditure is capped at approximately 2.5 times the basal metabolic rate. Triathlon is particularly notable for its high energetic demands due to its multimodal nature, requiring athletes to maintain high training volumes. In this case study, we analyzed the total energy expenditure of world-class triathlete Kristian Blummenfelt using doubly labelled water over two specific periods, along with three years of training data. Total energy expenditure ranged from 7,019-8,506 kcal/day, while energy intake ranged from 4,899 to 6,360 kcal/day. The annual training volumes for the years 2020-2022 were 1,480, 1,350 and 1,308 hours, respectively, following a pyramidal intensity distribution. Approximately 53% of the entire three-year period matched with the doubly labeled water measurement periods in terms of training volume, indicating that the recorded total energy expenditure is representative of the majority of the observed data. Hence, the greater part of the three-year period likely exceeds the proposed metabolic ceiling for sustained total energy expenditure. This not only questions the validity of the current metabolic limits but also suggests a new perspective on what is physiologically achievable in world-class athletes.},

abstract = {The main aim of this study was to investigate the training characteristics of the most successful female cross-country skier ever during the best period of her career. The participant won six gold medals at the Olympic Games, 18 gold medals at the World Championship, and 110 World Cup victories. Day-to-day training diary data, interviews, and physiological tests were analyzed. Training data was systemized by training form (endurance, strength, and speed), intensity [low- (LIT), moderate- (MIT), and high-intensity training (HIT)], and mode (running, cycling, and skiing/roller skiing), followed by a division into different periodization phases. Specific sessions utilized in the various periodization periods and the day-to-day periodization of training, in connection with altitude camps and tapering toward major championships, were also analyzed. Following a 12-year nonlinear increase in training load, the annual training volume during the five consecutive successful years stabilized at 937 ± 25 h, distributed across 543 ± 9 sessions. During these 5 years, total training time was distributed as 90.6% endurance-, 8.0% strength-, and 1.4% speed-training, with endurance-training time consisting of 92.3 ± 0.3% LIT, 2.9 ± 0.5% MIT, and 4.8 ± 0.5% HIT. Total LIT-time consisted of 21% warm-up, 14% sessions < 90 min, and 65% long-duration sessions > 90 min. While the total number of LIT sessions remained stable across phases (32 sessions), total LIT-time was reduced from GP (76 h/month) to SP (68 h/month) and CP (55 h/month). MIT-time decreased from GP (2.8 h/month) to SP (2.2 h/month) and CP (1 h/month). HIT-time increased from GP (2.8 h/month) to SP (3.2 h/month) and CP (4.7 h/month). Altitude training accounted for 18-25% of annual training volume and performed across relatively short training camps (≥16 days) with a clear reduction of HIT training, but increased total and LIT volume compared to sea-level training. Training before international championships included a 2-week increase in LIT and strength volume followed by a gradual reduction of training volume and increased HIT during the last week. This study provides unique data on the world's most successful female cross-country skier's long-term training process, including novel information about the distribution of and interplay between sessions of different forms, intensities, and exercise modes throughout the annual season.},

abstract = {Elite endurance athletes are characterized by markedly increased hemoglobin mass (Hbmass). It has been hypothesized that this adaptation may occur as a response to training at a very young age. Therefore, the aim of this study was to monitor changes in Hbmass in children aged 8-14 years following systematic endurance training. In the first study, Hbmass, VO2max, and lean body mass (LBM) were measured in 17 endurance-trained children (13 boys and 4 girls; aged 9.7 ± 1.3 years; training history 1.5±1.8 years; training volume 3.5 ± 1.6 h) twice a year for up to 3.5 years. The same parameters were measured once in a control group of 18 age-matched untrained children. Hbmass and blood volume (BV) were measured using the optimized CO-rebreathing technique, VO2max by an incremental test on a treadmill, and LBM by skin-fold measurements. In the second pilot study, the same parameters were measured in 9 young soccer athletes (aged 7.8 ± 0.2 years), and results were assessed in relation to soccer performance 2.5 years later. The increase in mean Hbmass during the period of study was 50% which was closely related to changes in LBM (r = 0.959). A significant impact of endurance training on Hbmass was observed in athletes exercising more than 4 h/week [+25.4 g compared to the group with low training volume (< 2 h/week)]. The greatest effects were related to LBM (11.4 g{\textperiodcentered}kg-1 LBM) and overlapped with the effects of age. A strong relationship was present between absolute Hbmass and VO2max (r = 0.939), showing that an increase of 1 g hemoglobin increases VO2max by 3.6 ml{\textperiodcentered}min-1. Study 2 showed a positive correlation between Hbmass and soccer performance 2.5 years later at age 10.3 ± 0.3 years (r = 0.627, p = 0.035). In conclusion, children with a weekly training volume of more than 4 h show a 7% higher Hbmass than untrained children.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of adding heavy strength training to female duathletes' normal endurance training on both cycling and running performance. Nineteen well-trained female duathletes (VO2max cycling: 54 ± 3 ml∙kg−1∙min−1, VO2max running: 53 ± 3 ml∙kg−1∙min−1) were randomly assigned to either normal endurance training (E, n = 8) or normal endurance training combined with strength training (E+S, n = 11). The strength training consisted of four lower body exercises [3 × 4-10 repetition maximum (RM)] twice a week for 11 weeks. Running and cycling performance were assessed using 5-min all-out tests, performed immediately after prolonged periods of submaximal work (3 h cycling or 1.5 h running). E+S increased 1RM in half squat (45 ± 22%) and lean mass in the legs (3.1 ± 4.0%) more than E. Performance during the 5-min all-out test increased in both cycling (7.0 ± 4.5%) and running (4.7 ± 6.0%) in E+S, whereas no changes occurred in E. The changes in running performance were different between groups. E+S reduced oxygen consumption and heart rate during the final 2 h of prolonged cycling, whereas no changes occurred in E. No changes occurred during the prolonged running in any group. Adding strength training to normal endurance training in well-trained female duathletes improved both running and cycling performance when tested immediately after prolonged submaximal work.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a microcycle of high-intensity interval training (HIT) sessions with multiple short work intervals followed by an active recovery period, compared to a similar duration of regular training, on determinants and indicators of endurance performance in well-trained cyclists. The participants in the BLOCK group performed a 6-day HIT microcycle including five HIT sessions (5 × 8.75-min 30/15 s short intervals) followed by a 6-day active recovery period with reduced training load, while the regular training group (REG) performed 12 days of their regular training, including four HIT sessions. Physiological testing was performed before and after the training periods. From pre- to post- intervention, BLOCK demonstrated significantly larger improvements than REG in mean power output (PO) during the last min of the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) test (POVO2max) (3.7 vs. 0.7%, p = 0.009, and effect size (ES) = 1.00) and mean PO during the 10-s sprint (2.8 vs. 1.9%, p = 0.028, and ES = 0.63). No significant differences between BLOCK and REG were observed for VO2max, PO at 4 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L−1 [blood lactate] (PO4mmol), 15-min maximal mean power output (PO15-min), and gross efficiency (p = 0.156–0.919). However, there was a tendency for larger improvements in the performance index (calculated from the main performance indicators POVO2max, PO4mmol, and PO15-min) in BLOCK compared to REG (2.9% vs. 1.2%, p = 0.079, and ES = 0.71). A 6-day high-intensity short-interval microcycle followed by a 6-day active recovery period induces improvements in endurance performance indicators compared to regular training, demonstrating its potential as an efficient strategy for endurance training in well-trained cyclists.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Sport-physiology and -performance research often relies on group designs  that compare experimental and control groups and/or preintervention and postintervention results. This commentary highlights the key elements of a high-quality case study and provides clear guidelines for readers and authors of the International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance. We propose 4 essential components. First, case studies should offer relevant and original insights by tackling novel issues and defining a clear purpose. Second, they must employ rigorous methodology, encompassing careful participant selection, comprehensive data collection from diverse sources (eg, interviews, surveys, physiological tests, training diaries, competition data), and deliberate data analysis that explicitly addresses factors influencing performance changes. Third, they should be well structured and engagingly presented to reach both academic and practical audiences. Finally, bridging the science-practice gap is vital, requiring and strengthening collaboration between researchers and practitioners to enable data-driven decision making and spark new hypotheses. CONCLUSIONS: Although case studies traditionally rank low in the research evidence hierarchy, high-quality examples can significantly bridge the gap between research and practice. By working closely with the sporting community and strategically sharing findings, case studies can enhance evidence-based training strategies and amplify the real-world impact of sport science.},

abstract = {Professional cycle racing is one of the most demanding of all sports combining extremes of exercise duration, intensity and frequency. Riders are required to perform on a variety of surfaces (track, road, cross-country, mountain), terrains (level, uphill and downhill) and race situations (criterions, sprints, time trials, mass-start road races) in events ranging in duration from 10 s to 3 wk stage races covering 200 m to 4,000 km. Furthermore, professional road cyclists typically have ∼ 100 race d/yr. Because of the diversity of cycle races, there are vastly different physiological demands associated with the various events. Until recently there was little information on the demands of professional cycling during training or competition. However, with the advent of reliable, valid bicycle crank dynanometers, it is now possible to quantify real-time power output, cadence and speed during a variety of track and road cycling races. This article provides novel data on the physiological demands of professional and world-class amateur cyclists and characterises some of the physiological attributes necessary for success in cycling at the {\'{e}}lite level.},

abstract = {Although a considerable amount of literature exists on the ergogenic potential of  ingesting sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) before short-term, high-intensity exercise, very little exists on optimal loading times before exercise. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of NaHCO3 supplementation timing on repeated sprint ability (RSA). Eight men completed 3 (randomized and counterbalanced) trials of ten 10-second sprints separated by 50 seconds of active recovery (1:5 work-to-rest) on a nonmotorized treadmill. Before each trial, the subjects ingested 0.3 g{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1) body weight of NaHCO3 at 60 (H1), 120 (H2), or 180 (H3) minutes before exercise. Additionally, the subjects were assessed for any side effects (gastrointestinal [GI] discomfort) from the NaHCO3 ingestion via a visual analog scale (VAS). Blood buffering was assessed using a 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures, whereas repeated sprint performance and GI discomfort were assessed via a 1-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Blood-buffering capacity was not different at preexercise times (HCO3(-) [millimoles per liter] H1: 30.2 ± 0.4, H2: 30.9 ± 0.6, H3: 31.2 ± 0.6; p > 0.74). Average speed, average power, and total distance covered progressively declined over the 10 sprints; however, there was no difference between conditions (p > 0.22). The incidence of GI discomfort was significantly higher (p < 0.05) from preingestion at all time points with the exception of 180 minutes, whereas severity was only different between 90 and 180 minutes. Ingestion times (between 60 and 180 minutes) did not influence the blood buffering or the ergogenic potential of NaHCO3 as assessed by RSA. However, VAS scores indicated that at 180 minutes postingestion, an individual is less prone to experiencing significant GI discomfort.},

abstract = {Purpose: To describe training variations across the annual cycle in Olympic and World Champion endurance athletes, and determine whether these athletes used tapering strategies in line with recommendations in the literature. Methods: Eleven elite XC skiers and biathletes (4 male; 28±1 yr, 85±5 mL. min-1. kg-1 V̇O2max, 7 female, 25±4 yr, 73±3 mL. min-1. kg-1 V̇O2max) reported one year of day-to-day training leading up to the most successful competition of their career. Training data were divided into periodization and peaking phases and distributed into training forms, intensity zones and endurance activity forms. Results: Athletes trained ∼800 h/500 sessions.year-1, including ∼500 h. year-1 of sport-specific training. Ninety-four percent of all training was executed as aerobic endurance training. Of this, ∼90% was low intensity training (LIT, below the first lactate threshold) and 10% high intensity training (HIT, above the first lactate threshold) by time. Categorically, 23% of training sessions were characterized as HIT with primary portions executed at or above the first lactate turn point. Training volume and specificity distribution conformed to a traditional periodization model, but absolute volume of HIT remained stable across phases. However, HIT training patterns tended to become more polarized in the competition phase. Training volume, frequency and intensity remained unchanged from pre-peaking to peaking period, but there was a 32±15% (P<.01) volume reduction from the preparation period to peaking phase. Conclusions: The annual training data for these Olympic and World champion XC skiers and biathletes conforms to previously reported training patterns of elite endurance athletes. During the competition phase, training became more sport-specific, with 92% performed as XC skiing. However, they did not follow suggested tapering practice derived from short-term experimental studies.

@article{Wagner2015,
abstract = {In 1968, Saltin et al. published a landmark paper describing the alterations in VO2max resulting from two sequential interventions - 20 days of bed rest and almost 8 weeks of training. They concluded that bed rest reduced VO2max through reductions in maximal cardiac output, while training enhanced VO2max by an equal combination of increased maximal cardiac output and increased arterio-venous [O2] difference (A-V $\Delta$ [O2]). At the time, A-V $\Delta$ [O2] was taken as an index of peripheral (skeletal muscle) adaptation. A key interpretive element that was not featured was consideration of how alterations in cardiac output affect the O2 extraction process secondary to changes in red cell transit time through the muscle microcirculation, even in the absence of adaptive changes in the skeletal muscles per se. For the 2015 Saltin Symposium, it was therefore thought appropriate to re-examine the 1968 O2 transport data and re-evaluate the roles central cardiovascular and peripheral muscle changes after bed rest and training allowing for their interaction. The analysis supports the conclusion that bed rest reduced VO2max mainly through reduction in cardiac output, but after training, it is proposed that the 1968 conclusions should be modified: the majority of the increase in VO2max from the control state can be attributed to an improvement in diffusive unloading of O2 from the muscle microcirculation, with a much smaller role for enhanced blood flow.},

abstract = {Introduction: To a considerable extent, the magnitude of blood volume (BV) and hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) contribute to the maximum O2-uptake (VO2max), especially in endurance-trained athletes. However, the development of Hbmass and BV and their relationships with VO2max during childhood are unknown. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to investigate Hbmass and BV and their relationships with VO2max in children and adolescents. In addition, the possible influence of endurance training and chronic hypoxia was evaluated. Methods: A total of 475 differently trained children and adolescents (girls n = 217, boys n = 258; untrained n = 171, endurance trained n = 304) living at two different altitudes (∼1,000 m, n = 204, ∼2,600 m, n = 271) and 9–18 years old participated in the study. The stage of puberty was determined according to Tanner; Hbmass and BV were determined by CO rebreathing; and VO2max was determined by cycle ergometry and for runners on the treadmill. Results: Before puberty, there was no association between training status and Hbmass or BV. During and after puberty, we found 7–10% higher values in the trained groups. Living at a moderate altitude had a uniformly positive effect of ∼7% on Hbmass in all groups and no effect on BV. The VO2max before, during and after puberty was strongly associated with training (pre/early puberty: boys +27%, girls +26%; mid puberty: +42% and +45%; late puberty: +43% and +47%) but not with altitude. The associated effects of training in the pre/early pubertal groups were independent of Hbmass and BV, while in the mid- and late pubertal groups, 25% of the training effect could be attributed to the elevated Hbmass. Conclusions: The associated effects of training on Hbmass and BV, resulting in increased VO2max, can only be observed after the onset of puberty.},

abstract = {Purpose: To examine the influence of post-exercise protein feeding upon the adaptive response to endurance exercise training. Methods: In a randomised parallel group design, 25 healthy men and women completed 6 weeks of endurance exercise training by running on a treadmill for 30–60 min at 70–75% maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) 4 times/week. Participants ingested 1.6 g per kilogram of body mass (g kg BM−1) of carbohydrate (CHO) or an isocaloric carbohydrate–protein solution (CHO-P; 0.8 g carbohydrate kg BM−1 + 0.8 g protein kg BM−1) immediately and 1 h post-exercise. Expired gas, blood and muscle biopsy samples were taken at baseline and follow-up. Results: Exercise training improved VO2max in both groups (p ≤ 0.001), but this increment was not different between groups either in absolute terms or relative to body mass (0.2 ± 0.2 L min−1 and 3.0 ± 2 mL kg−1 min−1, respectively). No change occurred in plasma albumin concentration from baseline to follow-up with CHO-P (4.18 ± 0.18 to 4.23 ± 0.17 g dL−1) or CHO (4.17 ± 0.17 to 4.12 ± 0.22 g dL−1; interaction: p ' 0.05). Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) gene expression was up-regulated in CHO-P (+ 46%; p = 0.025) relative to CHO (+ 4%) following exercise training. Conclusion: Post-exercise protein supplementation up-regulated the expression of mTOR in skeletal muscle over 6 weeks of endurance exercise training. However, the magnitude of improvement in VO2max was similar between groups.},

abstract = {Purpose Altitude training is a common strategy used with the intent to increase hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) in athletes. However, if the Hbmass is increased during altitude camps it seems to decline rapidly upon returning to sea level. This study aimed to examine the efficacy of three weekly heat training sessions over a 3.5-week period following a 3-week altitude camp, on the maintenance of Hbmass in elite cyclists. Methods Eighteen male cyclists (maximal oxygen consumption: 76 ± 5 mL{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) underwent a 3-week altitude training camp at ∼2100 m above sea level. After the camp, participants were divided into one group performing three weekly heat sessions that was subtracted from their usual training (HEAT) while the other continuing usual training (CON). Training characteristics were recorded during the intervention, while hematological measurements were recorded before the camp as well as two days and 3.5-weeks after the altitude camp. Results The 3-week altitude camp led to an overall increase in total Hbmass of 4.1%. Afterwards, HEAT maintained Hbmass (0.2%, p = 0.738), while CON group experienced a significant reduction (-3.3%, p < 0.001) ($\Delta$HEAT vs. $\Delta$CON, p < 0.001). Moreover, HEAT increased plasma volume (PV) by 11.6% (p = 0.007) and blood volume (BV) by 5.8% (p = 0.007), whereas CON only showed an increase in PV (5.5%, p = 0.041). Exercise intensity and training load were not different between groups during the maintenance period. Conclusions This study suggests that incorporating three weekly heat training sessions into the usual training routine preserves a moderately increased Hbmass in elite cyclists following an altitude camp.},

abstract = {New Findings: What is the topic of this review? We review recent work relating to exercise-induced alterations in mitochondrial structure and function. What advances does it highlight? Training mitochondrial volume density increases due to 1) an increase cross sectional area and 2) longitudinal growth. Specific respiratory alterations appear dependent on exercise training intensity. Low-moderate endurance training primarily improves the capacity for fat oxidation whereas high-intensity interval training (HIT) improves global respiratory capacity. The latter includes maximal state 3 mass-specific respiration, which is the strongest individual measure predictive of endurance performance. This highlights the importance of training specificity in endurance athletes. Mitochondrial volume density (MitoVD) is composed of two distinct mitochondrial subpopulations— intermyofibrillar mitochondria (MitoIMF) and subsarcolemmal mitochondria (MitoSS). With exercise training, MitoVD may increase by up to 40% and is, for the most part, related to an increase in MitoIMF. Exercise-induced adaptations in mitochondrial function depend on the intensity of training and appear to be explained predominately by an increased expression of mitochondrial enzymes that facilitate aerobic metabolism. Although mitochondrial content often increases with training, it seems that mitochondrial adaptations are not needed to facilitate maximal oxygen uptake, whereas such adaptations are of greater importance for endurance capacity.},

abstract = {Carbon monoxide (CO) rebreathing procedures are used to assess hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) but recent evidence suggests that CO is a signaling molecule that may alter physiological functions. We examined the effects of 10 days of intermittent, low-dose CO inhalation on Hbmass, aerobic performance predictors, and peak-power exercise tolerance. 18 recreationally-active men were randomized to either CO or placebo inhalation groups in a single-blind, pre-post parallel-groups trial. Primary outcomes were assessed before and after an intervention period during which subjects inhaled a bolus of 1.2 ml kg−1 CO or placebo (room air) for 30 s, once per day on 10 days over a 12-day period. Cycling tests were performed >16 h following CO inhalation to exclude acute effects of CO exposure. CO inhalation elevated carboxyhemoglobin by 4.4±0.4% (mean±SD) following each exposure. Compared to placebo, chronic CO inhalation did not significantly alter Hbmass (p=0.99), peak oxygen uptake (p=0.59), peak power output (p=0.10), submaximal oxygen uptake (p=0.91), submaximal RER (p=0.22), lactate threshold (p=0.65), or peak-power exercise tolerance (p=0.60). In conclusion, our data support the ability to perform repeated measurements of Hbmass using CO rebreathing over a 12-day period without altering physiological responses.},

abstract = {Efforts to understand human physiology through the study of champion athletes and record performances have been ongoing for about a century. For endurance sports three main factors - maximal oxygen consumption V̇O2max, the so-called 'lactate threshold' and efficiency (i.e. the oxygen cost to generate a give running speed or cycling power output) - appear to play key roles in endurance performance. V̇O2max and lactate threshold interact to determine the 'performance' which is the oxygen consumption that can be sustained for a given period of time. Efficiency interacts with the performance to establish the speed or power that can be generated at this oxygen consumption. This review focuses on what is currently known about how these factors interact, their utility as predictors of elite performance, and areas where there is relatively less information to guide current thinking. In this context, definitive ideas about the physiological determinants of running and cycling efficiency is relatively lacking in comparison with V̇O2max and the lactate threshold, and there is surprisingly limited and clear information about the genetic factors that might pre-dispose for elite performance. It should also be cautioned that complex motivational and sociological factors also play important roles in who does or does not become a champion and these factors go far beyond simple physiological explanations. Therefore, the performance of elite athletes is likely to defy the types of easy explanations sought by scientific reductionism and remain an important puzzle for those interested in physiological integration well into the future. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.

abstract = {Background: Altitude training stimulates erythropoietin hormone (EPO) release and increases blood hemoglobin (Hb) mass, which may result in improved oxygen (O2) transport capacity. It was hypothesized in the present study that periodic inhalation of carbon monoxide (CO) might elicit similar physiological adaptations compared to altitude training. Methods: Twelve male college student athletes, who were well-trained soccer players, participated. They performed a 4-week treadmill-training program, five times a week. Participants were randomly assigned into an experimental group with inhaling CO (INCO) (1 mL/kg body weight for 2 min) in O2 (4 L) before all training sessions and a control group without inhaling CO (NOCO). CO and EPO concentrations in venous blood were first measured acutely at the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th hour after INCO, and total hemoglobin mass (tHb), running economy and VO2max were measured before and after the 4 weeks training intervention. Results: HbCO% increased from 0.7 to 4.4% (P < 0.05) after 1 h of CO inhalation and EPO increased from 1.9 to 2.7 mIU/mL after 4 h post CO inhalation (P < 0.05) acutely before the intervention. After the training, the tHb and VO2max in the INCO group increased significantly by 3.7 and 2.7%, respectively, while no significant differences were observed in the NOCO condition. O2 uptake at given submaximal speeds declined by approximately 4% in the INCO group. Conclusion: Acutely, EPO increased sharply post CO inhalation, peaking at 4 h post inhalation. 4-weeks of training with CO inhalation before exercise sessions improved tHb and VO2max as well as running economy, suggesting that moderate CO inhalation could be a new method to improve the endurance performance in athletes.},

abstract = {Performing at an elite level in Nordic combined (NC) requires both the explosiveness required for ski jumping performance and the endurance capacity required for cross-country skiing. Purpose: To describe the characteristics of world-class NC athletes' training and determine how endurance and non-endurance (ie, strength, power, and ski jumping) training is periodized. Methods: Annual training characteristics and the periodization of endurance and non-endurance training were determined by analyzing the training diaries of 6 world-class NC athletes. Results: Of 846 ± 72 annual training hours, 540 ± 37 h were endurance training, with 88.6% being low-, 5.9% moderate-, and 5.5% high-intensity training. While training frequency remained relatively constant, the total training volume was reduced from the general preparatory to the competition phase, primarily due to less low- and moderate-intensity training (P <.05). A total of 236 ± 55 h/y were spent as non-endurance training, including 211 ± 44 h of power and ski-jump-specific training (908 ± 165 ski jumps and ski-jump imitations). The proportion of non-endurance training increased significantly toward the competition phase (P <.05). Conclusion: World-class NC athletes reduce the volume of low- and moderate-intensity endurance training toward the competition phase, followed by an increase in the relative contribution of power and ski-jump training. These data provide novel insight on how successful athletes execute their training and may facilitate more-precise coaching of future athletes in this sport. In addition, this information is of high relevance for the training organization of other sports that require optimization of 2 fundamentally different physical capacities.},

abstract = {In this review we integrate the scientific literature and results-proven practice and outline a novel framework for understanding the training and development of elite long-distance performance. Herein, we describe how fundamental training characteristics and well-known training principles are applied. World-leading track runners (i.e., 5000 and 10,000 m) and marathon specialists participate in 9 ± 3 and 6 ± 2 (mean ± SD) annual competitions, respectively. The weekly running distance in the mid-preparation period is in the range 160–220 km for marathoners and 130–190 km for track runners. These differences are mainly explained by more running kilometers on each session for marathon runners. Both groups perform 11–14 sessions per week, and ≥ 80% of the total running volume is performed at low intensity throughout the training year. The training intensity distribution vary across mesocycles and differ between marathon and track runners, but common for both groups is that volume of race-pace running increases as the main competition approaches. The tapering process starts 7–10 days prior to the main competition. While the African runners live and train at high altitude (2000–2500 m above sea level) most of the year, most lowland athletes apply relatively long altitude camps during the preparation period. Overall, this review offers unique insights into the training characteristics of world-class distance runners by integrating scientific literature and results-proven practice, providing a point of departure for future studies related to the training and development in the Olympic long-distance events.},

abstract = {Background: Exercise performance and capacity are impaired in hot, compared to temperate, conditions. Heat adaptation (HA) is one intervention commonly adopted to reduce this impairment because it may induce beneficial exercise performance and physiological and perceptual adaptations. A number of investigations have been conducted on HA but, due to large methodological differences, the effectiveness of different HA regimens remain unclear. Objectives: (1) To quantify the effect of different HA regimens on exercise performance and the physiological and perceptual responses to subsequent heat exposure. (2) To offer practical HA recommendations and suggestions for future HA research based upon a systematic and quantitative synthesis of the literature. Data Source: PubMed was searched for original research articles published up to, and including, 16 February 2016 using appropriate first- and second-order search terms. Study Selection: English-language, peer-reviewed, full-text original articles using human participants were reviewed using the four-stage process identified in the PRISMA statement. Data Extraction: Data for the following variables were obtained from the manuscripts by at least two of the authors: participant sex, maximal oxygen consumption and age; HA duration, frequency, modality, temperature and humidity; exercise performance and capacity; core and skin temperature; heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, skin blood flow, sweat onset temperature, body mass loss, sweat rate, perception of thirst, volitional fluid consumption, plasma volume changes; sweat concentrations of sodium, chloride and potassium; aldosterone, arginine vasopressin, heat shock proteins (Hsp), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and thermal sensation. Data Grouping: Data were divided into three groups based upon the frequency of the HA regimen. Performance and capacity data were also divided into groups based upon the type of HA used. Data Analyses: Hedges' g effect sizes and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated. Correlations were run where appropriate. Results: Ninety-six articles were reviewed. The most common duration was 7–14 days and the most common method of HA was the controlled work-rate approach. HA had a moderately beneficial effect on exercise capacity and performance in the heat irrespective of regimen; however, longer regimens were more effective than shorter approaches. HA had a moderate-to-large beneficial effect on lowering core body temperature before and during exercise, maintaining cardiovascular stability, and improving heat-loss pathways. Data are limited but HA may reduce oxygen consumption during subsequent exercise, improve glycogen sparing, increase the power output at lactate threshold, reduce lactate concentrations during exercise, have a trivial effect on increasing extracellular concentrations of Hsp, and improve perceived ratings of exertion and thermal sensation. Conclusion: HA regimens lasting <14 days induce many beneficial physiological and perceptual adaptations to high ambient temperatures, and improve subsequent exercise performance and capacity in the heat; however, the extent of the adaptations is greatest when HA regimens lasting longer than 14 days are adopted. Large methodological differences in the HA literature mean that there is still uncertainty regarding the magnitude and time course of potential adaptation for a number of physiological and perceptual variables.},

Thirty four cyclists completed one of three 10-day interventions 1) 50-min cycling per day in 35 °C, 2) 50-min cycling per day wearing thermal clothing, and 3) 50-min cycling wearing thermal clothing plus 25 min hot water immersion per day. Pre- and post-intervention hemoglobin mass, intravascular volumes and core temperature were determined at rest. Heart rate, sweat rate, blood lactate concentration and core temperature were evaluated during 15-min submaximal and 30-min all-out cycling performance conducted in 35.2 ± 0.1 °C and 61 ± 1% relative humidity. There were no significant between-group differences in any of the determined variables. None of the interventions statistically altered any of the parameters investigated as part of the 15-min submaximal trial. However, following the intervention period, heat chamber, thermal clothing and thermal clothing + hot water immersion all improved 30-min all-out average power in the heat (9.5 ± 3.8%, 9.5 ± 3.6 and 9.9 ± 5.2%, respectively, p < 0.001, F = 192.3). At termination of the 30-min all-out test, the increase in blood lactate concentration, rate of perceived exertion and sweat rate were not different between the three interventions. In conclusion, daily training sessions conducted either in ambient 35 °C, while wearing thermal clothing in temperate conditions or while wearing thermal clothing combined with hot water immersion are equally effective for improving exercise performance in the heat.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle glycogen is an important energy source for muscle  contraction and a key regulator of metabolic responses to exercise. Manipulation of muscle glycogen is therefore a strategy to improve performance in competitions and potentially adaptation to training. However, assessing muscle glycogen in the field is impractical, and there are no normative values for glycogen concentration at rest and during exercise. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to meta-analyse the effects of fitness, acute dietary carbohydrate (CHO) availability and other factors on muscle glycogen concentration at rest and during exercise of different durations and intensities. DATA SOURCE AND STUDY SELECTION: PubMed was used to search for original articles in English published up until February 2018. Search terms included muscle glycogen and exercise, filtered for humans. The analysis incorporated 181 studies of continuous or intermittent cycling and running by healthy participants, with muscle glycogen at rest and during exercise determined by biochemical analysis of biopsies. DATA ANALYSIS: Resting muscle glycogen was determined with a meta-regression mixed model that included fixed effects for fitness status [linear, as maximal oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]O(2max)) in mL{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1){\textperiodcentered}min(-1)] and CHO availability (three levels: high, ≥ 6 g{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1) of CHO per day for ≥ 3 days or ≥ 7 g{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1) CHO per day for ≥ 2 days; low, glycogen depletion and low-CHO diet; and normal, neither high nor low, or not specified in study). Muscle glycogen during exercise was determined with a meta-regression mixed model that included fixed effects for fitness status, resting glycogen [linear, in mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1) of dry mass (DM)], exercise duration (five levels, with means of 5, 23, 53 and 116 min, and time to fatigue), and exercise intensity (linear, as percentage of [Formula: see text]O(2max)); intensity, fitness and resting glycogen were interacted with duration, and there were also fixed effects for exercise modes, CHO ingestion, sex and muscle type. Random effects in both models accounted for between-study variance and within-study repeated measurement. Inferences about differences and changes in glycogen were based on acceptable uncertainty in standardised magnitudes, with thresholds for small, moderate, large and very large of 25, 75, 150 and 250 mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1) of DM, respectively. RESULTS: The resting glycogen concentration in the vastus lateralis of males with normal CHO availability and [Formula: see text]O(2max) (mean ± standard deviation, 53 ± 8 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1){\textperiodcentered}min(-1)) was 462 ± 132 mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1). High CHO availability was associated with a moderate increase in resting glycogen (102, ± 47 mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1); mean ± 90% confidence limits), whereas low availability was associated with a very large decrease (- 253, ± 30 mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1)). An increase in [Formula: see text]O(2max) of 10 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1){\textperiodcentered}min(-1) had small effects with low and normal CHO availability (29, ± 44 and 67, ± 15 mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1), respectively) and a moderate effect with high CHO availability (80, ± 40 mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1)). There were small clear increases in females and the gastrocnemius muscle. Clear modifying effects on glycogen utilisation during exercise were as follows: a 30% [Formula: see text]O(2max) increase in intensity, small (41, ± 20 mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1)) at 5 min and moderate (87-134 mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1)) at all other timepoints; an increase in baseline glycogen of 200 mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1), small at 5-23 min (28-59 mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1)), moderate at 116 min (104, ± 15 mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1)) and moderate at fatigue (143, ± 33 mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1)); an increase in [Formula: see text]O(2max) of 10 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1){\textperiodcentered}min(-1), mainly clear trivial effects; exercise mode (intermittent vs. continuous) and CHO ingestion, clear trivial effects. Small decreases in utilisation were observed in females (vs. males: - 30, ± 29 mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1)), gastrocnemius muscle (vs. vastus lateralis: - 31, ± 46 mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1)) and running (vs. cycling: - 70, ± 32 mmol{\textperiodcentered}kg(-1)). CONCLUSION: Dietary CHO availability and fitness are important factors for resting muscle glycogen. Exercise intensity and baseline muscle glycogen are important factors determining glycogen use during exercise, especially with longer exercise duration. The meta-analysed effects may be useful normative values for prescription of endurance exercise.},

abstract = {The power–duration relationship describes the time to exhaustion for exercise at different intensities. It is believed to be a “fundamental bioenergetic property of living systems” that this relationship is hyperbolic. Indeed, the hyperbolic (a.k.a. critical-power) model which formalises this belief is the dominant tool for describing and predicting high-intensity exercise performance, e.g. in cycling, running, rowing or swimming. However, the hyperbolic model is now the focus of a heated debate in the literature because it unrealistically represents efforts that are short (< 2 min) or long (> 15 min). We contribute to this debate by demonstrating that the power–duration relationship is more adequately represented by an alternative, power-law model. In particular, we show that the often-observed good fit of the hyperbolic model between 2 and 15 min should not be taken as proof that the power–duration relationship is hyperbolic. Rather, in this range, a hyperbolic function just happens to approximate a power law fairly well. We also prove mathematical results which suggest that the power-law model is a safer tool for pace selection than the hyperbolic model and that the former more naturally models fatigue than the latter.},

abstract = {Emerging trends in technological innovations, data analysis and practical applications have facilitated the measurement of cycling power output in the field, leading to improvements in training prescription, performance testing and race analysis. This review aimed to critically reflect on power profiling strategies in association with the power-duration relationship in cycling, to provide an updated view for applied researchers and practitioners. The authors elaborate on measuring power output followed by an outline of the methodological approaches to power profiling. Moreover, the deriving a power-duration relationship section presents existing concepts of power-duration models alongside exercise intensity domains. Combining laboratory and field testing discusses how traditional laboratory and field testing can be combined to inform and individualize the power profiling approach. Deriving the parameters of power-duration modelling suggests how these measures can be obtained from laboratory and field testing, including criteria for ensuring a high ecological validity (e.g. rider specialization, race demands). It is recommended that field testing should always be conducted in accordance with pre-established guidelines from the existing literature (e.g. set number of prediction trials, inter-trial recovery, road gradient and data analysis). It is also recommended to avoid single effort prediction trials, such as functional threshold power. Power-duration parameter estimates can be derived from the 2 parameter linear or non-linear critical power model: P(t) = W′/t + CP (W′—work capacity above CP; t—time). Structured field testing should be included to obtain an accurate fingerprint of a cyclist's power profile.},

@article{Puchowicz2020,
abstract = {Purpose: To validate and compare a novel model based on the critical power (CP) concept that describes the entire domain of maximal mean power (MMP) data from cyclists. Methods: An omni-domain power-duration (OmPD) model was derived whereby the rate of Wʹ expenditure is bound by maximum sprint power and the power at prolonged durations declines from CP log-linearly. The three-parameter CP (3CP) and exponential (Exp) models were likewise extended with the log-linear decay function (Om3CP and OmExp). Each model bounds Wʹ using a different nonconstant function, Wʹeff (effective Wʹ). Models were fit to MMP data from nine cyclists who also completed four time-trials (TTs). Results: The OmPD and Om3CP residuals (4 ± 1%) were smaller than the OmExp residuals (6 ± 2%; P < 0.001). Wʹeff predicted by the OmPD model was stable between 120–1,800 s, whereas it varied for the Om3CP and OmExp models. TT prediction errors were not different between models (7 ± 5%, 8 ± 5%, 7 ± 6%; P = 0.914). Conclusion: The OmPD offers similar or superior goodness-of-fit and better theoretical properties compared to the other models, such that it best extends the CP concept to short-sprint and prolonged-endurance performance.},

@article{Goulding2023,
abstract = {The physiological determinants of high-intensity exercise tolerance are important for both elite human performance and morbidity, mortality and disease in clinical settings. The asymptote of the hyperbolic relation between external power and time to task failure, critical power, represents the threshold intensity above which systemic and intramuscular metabolic homeostasis can no longer be maintained. After $\sim$ 60 years of research into the phenomenon of critical power, a clear understanding of its physiological determinants has emerged. The purpose of the present review is to critically examine this contemporary evidence in order to explain the physiological underpinnings of critical power. Evidence demonstrating that alterations in convective and diffusive oxygen delivery can impact upon critical power is first addressed. Subsequently, evidence is considered that shows that rates of muscle oxygen utilisation, inferred via the kinetics of pulmonary oxygen consumption, can influence critical power. The data reveal a clear picture that alterations in the rates of flux along every step of the oxygen transport and utilisation pathways influence critical power. It is also clear that critical power is influenced by motor unit recruitment patterns. On this basis, it is proposed that convective and diffusive oxygen delivery act in concert with muscle oxygen utilisation rates to determine the intracellular metabolic milieu and state of fatigue within the myocytes. This interacts with exercising muscle mass and motor unit recruitment patterns to ultimately determine critical power.},

@article{Skiba2012,
abstract = {Purpose: The critical power (CP) model includes two constants: the CP and the W′ [P = (W′/t) + CP]. The W′ is the finite work capacity available above CP. Power output above CP results in depletion of the W′ complete depletion of the W′ results in exhaustion. Monitoring the W′ may be valuable to athletes during training and competition. Our purpose was to develop a function describing the dynamic state of the W′ during intermittent exercise. Methods: After determination of V̇O2max, CP, and W′, seven subjects completed four separate exercise tests on a cycle ergometer on different days. Each protocol comprised a set of intervals: 60 s at a severe power output, followed by 30-s recovery at a lower prescribed power output. The intervals were repeated until exhaustion. These data were entered into a continuous equation predicting balance of W′ remaining, assuming exponential reconstitution of the W′. The time constant was varied by an iterative process until the remaining modeled W′ = 0 at the point of exhaustion. Results: The time constants of W′ recharge were negatively correlated with the difference between sub-CP recovery power and CP. The relationship was best fit by an exponential (r = 0.77). The model-predicted W′ balance correlated with the temporal course of the rise in V̇O2 (r = 0.82-0.96). The model accurately predicted exhaustion of the W′ in a competitive cyclist during a road race. Conclusions: We have developed a function to track the dynamic state of the W′ during intermittent exercise. This may have important implications for the planning and real-time monitoring of athletic performance. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

Methods The power-duration relationship and the actual and estimated W′REC were determined for 12 data sets extracted from our laboratory database where participants had completed two 3MT separated by 1-min recovery (i.e., control [C-3MT] and fatigued [F-3MT]). Results Actual W′REC (6.3 ± 1.4 kJ) was significantly overestimated by the W′BAL{\textperiodcentered}ODE (9.8 ± 1.3 kJ; P < 0.001) and the W′BAL{\textperiodcentered}MORTON (16.9 ± 2.6 kJ; P < 0.001) models but was not significantly different to the estimate provided by the W′BAL{\textperiodcentered}INT (7.5 ± 1.5 kJ; P > 0.05) model. End power (EP) was 7% lower in the F-3MT (263 ± 40 W) compared with the C-3MT (282 ± 44 W; P < 0.001), and work done above EP (WEP) was 61% lower in the F-3MT (6.3 ± 1.4 kJ) compared with the C-3MT (16.9 ± 3.2 kJ). The size of the error in the estimated W′REC was correlated with the reduction in WEP for the W′BAL{\textperiodcentered}INT and W′BAL{\textperiodcentered}ODE models (both r > -0.74, P < 0.01) but not the W′BAL{\textperiodcentered}MORTON model (r = -0.18, P > 0.05). Accounting for the changes in the power-duration relationship improved the accuracy of the W′BAL{\textperiodcentered}ODE and W′BAL{\textperiodcentered}MORTON, but they remained significantly different to actual W′REC. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that the power-duration relationship is altered after a 3MT, and accounting for these changes improves the accuracy of the W′BAL{\textperiodcentered}ODE and the W′BAL{\textperiodcentered}MORTON, but not W′BAL{\textperiodcentered}INT models. These results have important implications for the design and use of mathematical models describing the energetics of exercise performance.},

abstract = {The critical power (CP) is mathematically defined as the power-asymptote of the hyperbolic relationship between power output and time-to-exhaustion. Physiologically, the CP represents the boundary between the steady-state and nonsteady state exercise intensity domains and therefore may provide a more meaningful index of performance than other well-known landmarks of aerobic fitness such as the lactate threshold and the maximal O2 uptake. Despite the potential importance to sports performance, the CP is often misinterpreted as a purely mathematical construct which lacks physiological meaning and only in recent years has this concept begun to emerge as valid and useful technique for monitoring endurance fitness. This commentary defines the basic principles of the CP concept, outlines its importance to high-intensity exercise performance, and provides an overview of the current methods available for its assessment. Interventions including training, pacing and prior exercise can be used to alter the parameters of the power-time relationship. A future challenge lies in optimizing such interventions in order to positively affect the parameters of the power-time relationship and thereby enhance sports performance in specific events. {\textcopyright} 2011 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

abstract = {Background: The Critical Power model is used to monitor and predict the performance of elite cyclists. Using maximal power data from various durations the model calculates a maximal steady state intensity called Critical Power and a work capacity beyond this known as the W' (W-Prime). Much research has focussed on the bioenergetics of the Critical Power, however, less is known about the bioenergetic composition of the W'. Aim: The key aim of this study was to investigate the bioenergetics of the Critical Power model. Secondary aims were to compare four different Critical Power models against each other and determine the relationship between V̇Lamax and power output during extreme intensity exercise. Hypothesis: It was hypothesised that measures related to anaerobic pathways (Peak power, V̇Lamax) would better predict W', while measures related to aerobic pathways (Wmax, V̇O2max, VT1 and VT2 power outputs) would better predict CP. Methodology: Ten elite national level male cyclists participated in the study, with nine completing the study. Participants reported to the laboratory on three occasions separated by at least 24h, over a period of less than three weeks. In the first session participants completed a test to determine V̇Lamax, a 1-min time trial (TT), and a ramp test to determine V̇O2max, Wmax, VT1, and VT2. In the subsequent two sessions participants completed maximal four and ten-minute TT's which were used to determine Critical Power and W' using the Linear Time-Work model for the primary analysis. In the secondary analysis four Critical power models were formulated from all three TT efforts and compared against each other, while the 1-min TT was used to assess extreme intensity exercise capability. Results: CP was strongly correlated with the aerobic variables VT1 (r=0.72, r2=0.52, p=0.028), VT2 (r=0.85, r2=0.73, p=0.0035), V̇O2max (r=0.91, r2=0.83, p=0.0007) and Wmax (r=0.92, r2=0.84, p=0.0005). Power outputs at CP and VT2 were not significantly different for absolute (327 ± 41 vs 330 ± 37W, p=0.91) or relative (4.66 ± 0.54 vs 4.72 ± 0.58W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1, p=0.95) power output. The only significant relationships with W' were with V̇O2max (ml{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}kg-1)(r=-0.67, r2=0.45, p=0.047) and CP (W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) (r=-0.69, r2=0.47, p=0.042) Using variables related to bioenergetics multiple regression significantly predicted CP(W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) (p=0.001) and W' (p=0.034). The relative power output (W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) in the 1-min TT was significantly related to V̇Lamax (r=0.85, r2=0.73, p=0.0016), although work completed above CP in this effort was significantly less than W' (p=0.0008). All four Critical Power models were found to produce significantly different (p<.001) Critical Power and W' values, however, Critical Power was not significantly different to VT2 for any model (p=0.10-0.93). V̇Lamax could be significantly predicted from regression equations using both absolute (p=0.011) and relative (p=0.004) lactic interval power.. Conclusion: The Critical Power is further reinforced as an aerobic parameter, while W' categorisation is more difficult due to the involvement of maximal aerobic capability and both anaerobic systems. W' was negatively correlated with measures of relative aerobic capability (V̇O2max ml{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}kg-1, CP W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) and has been related positively to lean mass in previous research, indicating a possible link between muscle mass and W'. The relationship between V̇Lamax and relative 1-min TT power output (W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) supported the extreme intensity exercise domain being highly related to glycolytic capacity. The fact W' could not be depleted in this effort was hypothesised to occur due to a delay in the V̇O2 kinetics and therefore a delayed contribution of the Critical Power to the effort. All models produced significantly different outputs for Critical Power and W'. Although the Critical power was not significantly different to VT2 for any model, the individual variation in Critical Power between models and lack of criterion measure with which to validate an accurate W' makes it difficult to recommend a best model. Finally, the V̇Lamax was significantly predicted by power over the lactic power interval of the V̇Lamax test which may be useful for those wishing to measure the V̇Lamax of elite cyclists without specialist equipment.},

abstract = {(Formula presented.) estimates an athlete's maximal-glycolytic rate. This study aimed to determine the relationships between the (Formula presented.) and cycle ergometry efforts with a high-glycolytic energy contribution and the influence of (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) on respiratory compensation point. Eleven national-international endurance cyclists ((Formula presented.) = 70.7 ± 5.9 ml{\textperiodcentered}kg−1{\textperiodcentered}min−1) completed a 15-s isokinetic-test with pre- and postlactate measurements to determine (Formula presented.), a 1-min maximal effort, and a ramp test to exhaustion in a single test session. The main findings showed strong relationships between (Formula presented.) and the mean absolute (r = 0.83, p =.002) and relative (r = 0.88, p =.0004) power during the lactic interval of the 15-s isokinetic-test. This relationship weakened when comparing (Formula presented.) with mean absolute (r = 0.52, p =.098) and relative (r = 0.29, p =.393) power during a 1-min maximal effort. Combining the (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) data through multiple regression resulted in a positive effect on the estimation of respiratory compensation point. It was concluded that the (Formula presented.) is a relevant indicator of maximal glycolytic rate. However, this metric currently lacks scientific validation as an accurate estimate of glycolytic rate and provides minimal extra information over using the power output from the isokinetic test alone. Practitioners may simply measure power over glycolytically demanding efforts to understand the maximal glycolytic rate of their athletes.},

abstract = {Introduction: The maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) is defined as the highest workload that can be maintained without blood lactate accumulation over time. The power output at MLSS (PMLSS) is regularly implemented to define training zones, quantify training progress, or predict race performance. The gold standard methodology for MLSS determination requires two to five trials of constant-load exercise, which limits the practical application in training. The INSCYD software can calculate the PMLSS (PMLSSINSCYD) based on physiological data that can be obtained during a ∼1 h laboratory visit. However, to the best of our knowledge, the validity of the most recent software version has not yet been investigated. This study aimed to assess the validity of the software's calculations on PMLSS in cycling. Methods: The data for this study were retrieved from two published scientific sources. Thirty-one cyclists (19 males, 12 females) performed a 15 s sprint to estimate the VLamax, a ramp test for the (Formula presented.) assessment, and two to five constant-load tests to determine the PMLSS. The INSCYD software was used to calculate the PMLSS based on the (Formula presented.), VLamax, sex, body mass, and body composition. Results: The PMLSSINSCYD was higher than the PMLSS in the entire sample (mean difference: 4.6 W, p < 0.05, 95% CI 0.8–8.3 W) and in men (mean difference: 6.6 W, p < 0.05, 95% CI 1.3–11.8 W), but not in women (mean difference: 0.8 W, n.s., 95% CI −3.7 to 5.3 W), which was within the typical error of the PMLSS estimations (∼3%). In 12 subjects (nine males, three females), the PMLSSINSCYD differed by 3.1–7.3% compared to the MLSS. The Pearson correlations between the measured PMLSS and the calculated PMLSS (PMLSSINSCYD) were very strong in men (r = 0.974, p < 0.001, 95% CI 0.933–0.99), women (r = 0.984, p < 0.001, 95% CI 0.931–0.996), and for the entire sample (r = 0.992, p < 0.001, 95% CI 0.982–0.996). Discussion: In conclusion, the PMLSS can be accurately calculated using the INSCYD software, but it still requires advanced testing equipment to collect valid (Formula presented.) and VLamax data.},

abstract = {Serious amateur and elite athletes regularly take part in structured physiological testing sessions so that their progress gets tracked and training loads in the training plan correctly prescribed. Commonly, athletes are tested for the maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max) and maximal lactate steady state intensity (MLSS). While for the former expensive laboratory equipment is required, the latter requires multiple exercise trials for accurate determination. INSCYD athletic performance software is designed to enable continuous monitoring of these two parameters throughout the season after undertaking a single visit exercise testing session involving blood lactate sampling and power output measurement. The purpose of the present study was to assess validity of the software by its estimates of V̇O2max and MLSS and compare them to gold standard laboratory measures. 11 trained participants (V̇O2max 61.0 ± 7.9 mL ∙ kg-1 ∙ min-1) took part in this study consisting of formal graded V̇O2max test, multiple MLSS trials and a recommended test to obtain the data later fed the INSCYD athletic performance software. Both V̇O2max relative (∆=0.13 ml.kg-1.min-1, p=0.885) and MLSS calculated values (∆=2 W, p=0.655) were within expected daily variation and thus the estimations considered valid. It can be concluded that INSCYD athletic performance software offers its users utility to accurately predict V̇O2max and MLSS provided that the practitioner has a good idea of where the MLSS lies. However, caution is required when interpreting other parameter estimates provided by the software due their questionable scientific validity.},

abstract = {Purpose and Methods To test whether heat training performed as 5 × 50-min sessions per week for 5 wk in a heat chamber (CHAMBER) or while wearing a heat suit (SUIT), in temperate conditions, increases hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) and endurance performance in elite cyclists, compared with a control group (CON-1). Furthermore, after the 5-wk intervention, we tested whether three sessions per week for 3 wk with heat suit (SUITmain) would maintain Hbmass elevated compared with athletes who returned to normal training (HEATstop) or who continued to be the control group (CON-2). Results During the initial 5 wk, SUIT and CHAMBER increased Hbmass (2.6% and 2.4%) to a greater extent than CON-1 (-0.7%; both P < 0.01). The power output at 4 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L-1 blood lactate and 1-min power output (Wmax) improved more in SUIT (3.6% and 7.3%, respectively) than CON-1 (-0.6%, P < 0.05; 0.2%, P < 0.01), whereas this was not the case for CHAMBER (1.4%, P = 0.24; 3.4%, P = 0.29). However, when SUIT and CHAMBER were pooled this revealed a greater improvement in a performance index (composed of power output at 4 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L-1 blood lactate, Wmax, and 15-min power output) than CON-1 (4.9% ± 3.2% vs 1.7% ± 1.1%, respectively; P < 0.05). During the 3-wk maintenance period, SUITmain induced a larger increase in Hbmass than HEATstop (3.3% vs 0.8%; P < 0.05), which was not different from the control (CON-2; 1.6%; P = 0.19), with no differences between HEATstop and CON-2 (P = 0.52). Conclusions Both SUIT and CHAMBER can increase Hbmass, and pooling SUIT and CHAMBER demonstrates that heat training can increase performance. Furthermore, compared with cessation of heat training, a sustained increase in Hbmass was observed during a subsequent 3-wk maintenance period, although the number of weekly heat training sessions was reduced to 3.},
