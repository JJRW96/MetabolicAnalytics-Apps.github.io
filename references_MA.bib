abstract = {Study aim: Oxygen Uptake (VO 2 ) is avaluable metric for the prescription of exercise intensity and the monitoring of training progress. However, VO 2 is difficult to assess in anon-laboratory setting. Recently, an artificial neural network (ANN) was used to predict VO 2 responses during aset walking protocol on the treadmill [9]. The purpose of the present study was to test the ability of an ANN to predict VO 2 responses during cycling at self-selected intensities using Heart Rate (HR), time derivative of HR, power output, cadence, and body mass data. Material and methods: 12 moderately-active adult males (age: 21.1 ± 2.5 years) performed a50-minute bout of cycling at a variety of exercise intensities. VO 2 , HR, power output, and cadence were recorded throughout the test. An ANN was trained, validated and tested using the following inputs: HR, time derivative of HR, power output, cadence, and body mass. A twelve-fold hold-out cross validation was conducted to determine the accuracy of the model. Results: The ANN accurately predicted the experimental VO 2 values throughout the test (R 2 = 0.91 ± 0.04, SEE = 3.34 ± 1.07 mL/kg/min). Discussion: This preliminary study demonstrates the potential for using an ANN to predict VO 2 responses during cycling at varied intensities using easily accessible inputs. The predictive accuracy is promising, especially considering the large range of intensities and long duration of exercise. Expansion of these methods could allow ageneral algorithm to be developed for a more diverse population, improving the feasibility of oxygen uptake assessment.},

abstract = {Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) is the maximum amount of oxygen attainable by a person during exercise. VO2 max is used in different domains including sports and medical sciences and is usually measured during an incremental treadmill or cycle ergometer test. The drawback of directly measuring VO2 max using the maximal test is that it is expensive and requires a fixed and controlled protocol. During the last decade, various machine learning models have been developed for VO2 max prediction and numerous studies have attempted to predict VO2 max using data from submaximal and non-exercise tests. This article gives an overview of the machine learning models developed over the past five years (2016–2021) for the prediction of VO2 max. Multiple linear regression, support vector machine, artificial neural network and multilayer perceptron are some of the techniques that have been used to build predictive models using different combinations of predictor variables. Model performance is generally assessed using correlation coefficient (R-value), standard error of estimate (SEE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), computed between ground truth and predicted values. The findings of this review indicate that models using ANN typically outperform other machine learning techniques. Moreover, the predictor variables used to build the model have a large influence on the model's predictive performance.},

abstract = {The study of elite athletes provides a unique opportunity to define the upper limits of human physiology and performance. Across a variety of sports, these individuals have trained to optimize the physiological parameters of their bodies in order to compete on the world stage. To characterize endurance capacity, techniques such as heart rate monitoring, indirect calorimetry, and whole blood lactate measurement have provided insight into oxygen utilization, and substrate utilization and preference, as well as total metabolic capacity. However, while these techniques enable the measurement of individual, representative variables critical for sports performance, they lack the molecular resolution that is needed to understand which metabolic adaptations are necessary to influence these metrics. Recent advancements in mass spectrometry-based analytical approaches have enabled the measurement of hundreds to thousands of metabolites in a single analysis. Here we employed targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches to investigate whole blood responses to exercise in elite World Tour (including Tour de France) professional cyclists before and after a graded maximal physiological test. As cyclists within this group demonstrated varying blood lactate accumulation as a function of power output, which is an indicator of performance, we compared metabolic profiles with respect to lactate production to identify adaptations associated with physiological performance. We report that numerous metabolic adaptations occur within this physically elite population (n = 21 males, 28.2 ± 4.7 years old) in association with the rate of lactate accumulation during cycling. Correlation of metabolite values with lactate accumulation has revealed metabolic adaptations that occur in conjunction with improved endurance capacity. In this population, cycling induced increases in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites and Coenzyme A precursors. These responses occurred proportionally to lactate accumulation, suggesting a link between enhanced mitochondrial networks and the ability to sustain higher workloads. In association with lactate accumulation, altered levels of amino acids before and after exercise point to adaptations that confer unique substrate preference for energy production or to promote more rapid recovery. Cyclists with slower lactate accumulation also have higher levels of basal oxidative stress markers, suggesting long term physiological adaptations in these individuals that support their premier competitive status in worldwide competitions.},

abstract = {Background: The Critical Power model is used to monitor and predict the performance of elite cyclists. Using maximal power data from various durations the model calculates a maximal steady state intensity called Critical Power and a work capacity beyond this known as the W' (W-Prime). Much research has focussed on the bioenergetics of the Critical Power, however, less is known about the bioenergetic composition of the W'. Aim: The key aim of this study was to investigate the bioenergetics of the Critical Power model. Secondary aims were to compare four different Critical Power models against each other and determine the relationship between V̇Lamax and power output during extreme intensity exercise. Hypothesis: It was hypothesised that measures related to anaerobic pathways (Peak power, V̇Lamax) would better predict W', while measures related to aerobic pathways (Wmax, V̇O2max, VT1 and VT2 power outputs) would better predict CP. Methodology: Ten elite national level male cyclists participated in the study, with nine completing the study. Participants reported to the laboratory on three occasions separated by at least 24h, over a period of less than three weeks. In the first session participants completed a test to determine V̇Lamax, a 1-min time trial (TT), and a ramp test to determine V̇O2max, Wmax, VT1, and VT2. In the subsequent two sessions participants completed maximal four and ten-minute TT's which were used to determine Critical Power and W' using the Linear Time-Work model for the primary analysis. In the secondary analysis four Critical power models were formulated from all three TT efforts and compared against each other, while the 1-min TT was used to assess extreme intensity exercise capability. Results: CP was strongly correlated with the aerobic variables VT1 (r=0.72, r2=0.52, p=0.028), VT2 (r=0.85, r2=0.73, p=0.0035), V̇O2max (r=0.91, r2=0.83, p=0.0007) and Wmax (r=0.92, r2=0.84, p=0.0005). Power outputs at CP and VT2 were not significantly different for absolute (327 ± 41 vs 330 ± 37W, p=0.91) or relative (4.66 ± 0.54 vs 4.72 ± 0.58W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1, p=0.95) power output. The only significant relationships with W' were with V̇O2max (ml{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}kg-1)(r=-0.67, r2=0.45, p=0.047) and CP (W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) (r=-0.69, r2=0.47, p=0.042) Using variables related to bioenergetics multiple regression significantly predicted CP(W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) (p=0.001) and W' (p=0.034). The relative power output (W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) in the 1-min TT was significantly related to V̇Lamax (r=0.85, r2=0.73, p=0.0016), although work completed above CP in this effort was significantly less than W' (p=0.0008). All four Critical Power models were found to produce significantly different (p<.001) Critical Power and W' values, however, Critical Power was not significantly different to VT2 for any model (p=0.10-0.93). V̇Lamax could be significantly predicted from regression equations using both absolute (p=0.011) and relative (p=0.004) lactic interval power.. Conclusion: The Critical Power is further reinforced as an aerobic parameter, while W' categorisation is more difficult due to the involvement of maximal aerobic capability and both anaerobic systems. W' was negatively correlated with measures of relative aerobic capability (V̇O2max ml{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}kg-1, CP W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) and has been related positively to lean mass in previous research, indicating a possible link between muscle mass and W'. The relationship between V̇Lamax and relative 1-min TT power output (W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) supported the extreme intensity exercise domain being highly related to glycolytic capacity. The fact W' could not be depleted in this effort was hypothesised to occur due to a delay in the V̇O2 kinetics and therefore a delayed contribution of the Critical Power to the effort. All models produced significantly different outputs for Critical Power and W'. Although the Critical power was not significantly different to VT2 for any model, the individual variation in Critical Power between models and lack of criterion measure with which to validate an accurate W' makes it difficult to recommend a best model. Finally, the V̇Lamax was significantly predicted by power over the lactic power interval of the V̇Lamax test which may be useful for those wishing to measure the V̇Lamax of elite cyclists without specialist equipment.},

An overall time constant (tau T, determined as O2 deficit for the total response divided by net end-exercise VO2) and a primary time constant (tau P, determined from the O2 deficit and the amplitude for the early primary VO2 response) were compared. The tau T rose with power output and end-exercise lactate levels, but tau P was virtually invariant, even at high end-exercise lactate levels. Moreover the gain of the primary exponential component (as delta VO2/delta W) was constant across power outputs and blood lactate levels, suggesting that the primary VO2 response reflects a linear system, even at higher power outputs.

Seminal findings of the mitochondrial lactate oxidation complex (mLOC) elucidated the architectural structure of its components. Here, we report that the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (mPC) is an additional member of the mLOC in mouse muscle and C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes. Immunoblots, mass spectrometry, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments of mitochondrial preparations revealed abundant amounts of mitochondrial lactate dehydrogenase (mLDH), monocarboxylate transporter (mMCT), basigin (CD147), cytochrome oxidase (COx), and pyruvate carriers 1 and 2 (mPC1 and 2). In addition, using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and in situ proximity ligation, we also demonstrated planar and three-dimensional (3-D) colocalization of pyruvate and lactate transporters with COx in fixed mouse skeletal muscle sections and C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes skeletal muscle sections, mouse muscle and C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes myotubes, and C2C12 myoblasts.

abstract = {Purpose Dynamic apnea with fins (DYN) involves swimming the longest distance relying solely on the body's oxygen and anaerobic energy stores. The energy cost per unit distance (C) is therefore an important determinant of DYN performance, yet it has never been measured. This study aimed to assess the C of DYN and its aerobic (EO2), anaerobic lactic (ELa) and alactic (EPCr) energy contributions. Methods In a 50-m swimming pool, 22 freedivers (three female, ten using bi-fins, six the monofin, six both) performed a 50-m DYN, and seven also a 100-m DYN. Net C (above resting) was calculated from the O2 debt measured at emersion plus ELa (calculated from the blood lactate increase). In nine subjects (six of whom performed also the 100-m DYN), determination of hemoglobin mass and total lung capacity allowed the estimation of EO2 and, by subtraction, EPCr. Results C was unchanged between the 100-m and the 50-m DYN (p = 0.81) and resulted higher with bi-fins than with the monofin (7.4 ± 2.2 vs. 5.5 ± 1.6 J/kg/m, p = 0.02) due to a higher O2 debt and ELa. DYN personal best correlated better with the distance swum per unit of EO2 at 50 m (R2 = 0.70) than with C (R2 = 0.25). From 50 m to 100 m, fractional EO2 decreased (58% ± 19% to 47% ± 13%, p = 0.02), ELa increased (10% ± 5% to 21% ± 5%, p < 0.001) and EPCr was unchanged (31% ± 20% to 32% ± 15%, p = 0.83). Conclusions The C of DYN seems compatible with published values for surface swimming with fins at the same speed. At 100 m, ELa and EPCr were disproportionately high for the exercise intensity, possibly due to a diving response. Sparing EO2 is at least as important as C in determining DYN performance.

abstract = {Today, researchers, practitioners, and physicians measure the concentration of lactate during a graded exercise test to determine thresholds related to the maximal lactate steady state (maxLass) as a sensitive measure of endurance capacity. In the 1970s and 1980s, a group of Cologne-based researchers around Wildor Hollmann, Alois Mader, and Hermann Heck developed the methodology for systematic lactate testing and introduced a 4 mmol.L−1 lactate threshold. Later, they also developed the concept of the maxLass, and Mader designed a sophisticated mathematical model of human energy metabolism during exercise. Mader`s model simulates metabolic responses to exercise based on individual variables such as maximum oxygen uptake ((Formula presented.) O2max) and the maximal rate of lactate formation ($\nu$La.max). Mader's model predicts that the $\nu$La.max reduces the power at the anaerobic threshold and endurance performance but that a high $\nu$La.max is required for events with high power outputs in elite athletes. Mader's model also assumed before the millennium that the rate of fat oxidation is explained by the difference between glycolytic pyruvate synthesis and the actual rate of pyruvate oxidation which is consistent with current opinion. Mader's model also simulated the (Formula presented.) O2max slow component in the mid-1980s. Unfortunately, several landmark studies by the Cologne group were only published in German, and as a result, contributions by the Cologne group are under-appreciated in the English-speaking world. This narrative review aims to introduce key contributions of the Cologne group to human metabolism research especially for readers who do not speak German.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aims of this study were: (i) develop a performance predictor model based on the swimmers' biomechanical profile; (ii) relate the partial contribution of the main predictors with the training program and; (iii) analyze the time effect, sex effect and time X sex interaction. Methods: Ninety one swimmers (44 boys: 12.04 ± 0.81 years-old, 47 girls: 11.22 ± 0.98 years-old) were evaluated during a 3-year period. The decimal age, anthropometric, kinematic and efficiency features were collected in ten different moments over three seasons (i.e. longitudinal research). Hierarchical linear modeling was the procedure used to estimate the performance predictors. Results: Performance improved between season #1 - early and season #3 - late for both sexes (boys: 26.9% [20.88;32.96]; girls: 16.1% [10.34;22.54]). The decimal age (Estimate: -2.05; P < 0.001), arm span (Estimate: -0.59; P < 0.001), stroke length (Estimate: 3.82; P = 0.002) and propelling efficiency (Estimate: -0.17; P = 0.001) entered in the final model. Conclusion: Our results showed that over three consecutive seasons young swimmers' performance improved. Performance is a multifactorial phenomenon where anthropometrics, kinematics and efficiency were the main determinants. The change of these factors over time was coupled with the training plans of this talent ID program.},

abstract = {Cycling cadence (RPM)-related differences in blood lactate concentration (BLC) increase with increasing exercise intensity, whilst corresponding divergences in oxygen uptake (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) decrease. Aim of the present study was to test whether a higher RPM reduces the fraction (%) of theVO2 used for carbohydrate oxidation (relCHO) at a given BLC. Eight males (23.9 ± 1.6 yrs; 177 ± 3 cm; 70.3 ± 3.4 kg) performed incremental load tests at 50 and 100 RPM. BLC,VO2 andVCO2 were measured. At respiratory exchange ratios (RER) 1, relCHO were calculated and the constant determining 50 % relCHO (kCHO) was approximated as a function of the BLC. At submaximal workloadVO2,VCO2, and relCHO were lower (all p 0.002; {\c{c}}0.209) at 50 than at 100 RPM. No differences were observed inVO2peak (3.96 ± 0.22 vs. 4.00 ± 0.25 l min-1) and RERpeak (1.18 ± 0.02 vs. 1.15 ± 0.02). BLC was lower (p 0.001; {\c{c}} = 0.680) at 50 than at 100 RPM irrespective of cycling intensity. At 50 RPM, kCHO (4.2 ± 1.4 (mmol l-1)3) was lower (p = 0.043; {\c{c}} = 0.466) than at 100 RPM (5.9 ± 1.9 (mmol l-1)3). This difference in kCHO reflects a reduced CHO oxidation at a given BLC at 100 than at 50 RPM. At a low exercise intensity, a higher cycling cadence can substantially reduce the reliance on CHO at a given metabolic rate and/or BLC.},

abstract = {Purpose: To test whether the oxygen uptake (V˙ O2) plateau at V˙ O2max is simply a calculation artifact caused by the variability of V˙ O2 or a clearly identifiable physiological event. Methods: Forty-six male participants performed an incremental ramp and a V˙ O2max verification test. Variability of the difference between adjacent sampling intervals (difference) and of the slope of the V˙ O2–workload relationship (slope) in the submaximal intensity domain were calculated. Workload defined sampling intervals used for the calculation of the difference and slope were systematically increased from 20 to 100 W until the expected risk of false plateau diagnoses based on the Gaussian distribution function was lower than 5%. Overall, more than 1500 differences and slopes were analyzed. Subsequently, frequencies of plateau diagnoses in the submaximal and maximal intensity domains were compared. Results: Variability of the difference and slope decreased with increasing sampling interval (p < 0.001). At a sampling interval of 50 W, the predefined acceptable risk of false plateau diagnoses (≤ 5%) was achieved. At this sampling interval, the actual frequency (1.4%) of false-positive plateau diagnoses did not differ from the expected frequency in the submaximal intensity domain (1.6%; p = 0.491). In contrast, the actual frequency at maximal intensity (35.7%) was significantly higher compared to the submaximal intensity domain (p < 0.001) and even higher than the expected frequency of false-positive diagnoses (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The V˙ O2 plateau at V˙ O2max represents a physiological event and no calculation artifact caused by V˙ O2 variability. However, detecting a V˙ O2 plateau with sufficient certainty requires large sampling intervals.},

abstract = {A flattening of the oxygen uptake–work rate relationship at severe exercise indicates the achievement of maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2 max). Unfortunately, a distinct plateau (VO 2pl) at VO 2 maxis not found in all participants. The aim of this investigation was to critically review the influence of research methods and physiological factors on the VO 2pl incidence. It is shown that many studies used inappropriate definitions or methodical approaches to check for the occurrence of a VO 2pl. In contrast to the widespread assumptions it is unclear whether there is higher VO 2pl incidence in (uphill) running compared to cycling exercise or in discontinuous compared to continuous incremental exercise tests. Furthermore, most studies that evaluated the validity of supramaximal verification phases, reported verification bout durations, which are too short to ensure that VO 2 max have been achieved by all participants. As a result, there is little evidence for a higher VO 2pl incidence and a corresponding advantage for the diagnoses of VO 2 max when incremental tests are supplemented by supramaximal verification bouts. Preliminary evidence suggests that the occurrence of a VO 2pl in continuous incremental tests is determined by physiological factors like anaerobic capacity, VO 2-kinetics and accumulation of metabolites in the submaximal intensity domain. Subsequent studies should take more attention to the use of valid VO 2pl definitions, which require a cut-off at $\sim$ 50% of the submaximal VO 2 increase and rather large sampling intervals. Furthermore, if verification bouts are used to verify the achievement of VO 2 peak/VO 2 max, it should be ensured that they can be sustained for sufficient durations.},

abstract = {The effect of different pedalling rates (40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 rev min-1) on power generating capability oxygen uptake (V̇(O2)) and blood lactate concentration [La], during incremental tests was studied in seven subjects. No significant differences in V(O2,max) were found (mean ± S.D., 5.31 ± 0.13 l min-1). The final external power output delivered to the ergometer during incremental tests (P(I,max)) was not significantly different when cycling at 60, 80 or 100 rev min-1 (366 ± 5 W). A significant decrease in P(I,max) of $\sim$ 60 W was observed at 40 and 120 rev min-1 compared with 60 and 100 rev min-1, respectively (P < 0.01). At 120 rev min-1 there was also a pronounced upward shift of the V̇(O2)-power output (V̇(O2)-P) relationship. At 50 W $\Delta$V̇(O2) between 80 and 100 rev min-1 amounted to +0.43 l min-1 but to +0.87 l min-l between 100 and 120 rev min-1. The power output corresponding to 2 and 4 mmol l-1 blood lactate concentration (P([LA]2) and P([LA]4)) was also significantly lower (> 50 W) at 120 rev min-1 (P < 0.01) while pedalling at 40, 60, 80 and 100 rev min-1 showed no significant difference. The maximal peak power output (P(M,max)) during 10 s sprints increased with pedalling rate up to 100 rev min-1. Our study indicates that with increasing pedalling rate the reserves in power generating capability increase, as illustrated by the P(I,max)/P(M,max) ratio (54.8, 44.8, 38.1, 34.6, 29.2%), the P([LA]4)/P(M,max) ratio (50.4, 38.9, 31.0, 27.7, 22.9%) and the P([LA]2)/P(M,max) ratio (42.8, 33.5, 25.6, 23.1, 15.6%) increases. Taking into consideration the V̇(O2,max), the P(I,max) and the reserve in power generating capability we concluded that choosing a high pedalling rate when performing high intensity cycling exercise may be beneficial since it provides greater reserve in power generating capability and this may be advantageous to the muscle in terms of resisting fatigue. However, beyond 100 rev min-1 there is a decrease in external power that can be delivered for an given V(O2) with an associated earlier onset of metabolic acidosis and clearly this will be disadvantageous for sustained high intensity exercise.},

We tested the hypotheses that (1) %V˙ O2_MLSS is positively correlated with the ability to sustain a high fraction of V˙ O2max for a given competition duration (%V˙ O2_TT); (2) %V˙ O2_MLSS improves the prediction of the average power output of a time trial (PO_TT) in addition to V˙ O2max and gross efficiency (GE); (3) PO_MLSS improves the prediction of PO_TT in addition to V˙ O2max and GE. Methods: Twenty-one recreationally active participants performed stepwise incremental tests on the first and final testing day to measure GE and check for potential test-related training effects in terms of changes in the minimal lactate equivalent power output (∆PO_LEmin), 30-min constant load tests to determine MLSS, a ramp test and verification bout for V˙ O2max, and 20-min time trials for %V˙ O2_TT and PO_TT. Hypothesis 1 was tested via bivariate and partial correlations between %V˙ O2_MLSS and %V˙ O2_TT. Multiple regression models with V˙ O2max, GE, ∆PO_LEmin, and %V˙ O2_MLSS (Hypothesis 2) or PO_MLSS instead of %V˙ O2_MLSS (Hypothesis 3), respectively, as predictors, and PO_TT as the dependent variable were used to test the hypotheses. Results: %V˙ O2_MLSS was not correlated with %V˙ O2_TT (r = 0.17, p = 0.583). Neither %V˙ O2_MLSS (p = 0.424) nor PO_MLSS (p = 0.208) did improve the prediction of PO_TT in addition to V˙ O2max and GE. Conclusion: These results challenge the assumption that PO_MLSS or %V˙ O2_MLSS are independent predictors of supra-MLSS PO_TT and %V ˙ O2_TT.},

Twenty-six male participants performed a standard ramp test (increment: 30 W{\textperiodcentered}min−1), a ramp test with an individualized ramp slope and a two-step (moderate and severe) square wave exercise followed by a (Formula presented.) -verification bout. VO2DEF was calculated by the difference between individualized ramp test (Formula presented.) O2 and (Formula presented.) O2-demand estimated from steady-state (Formula presented.) O2-kinetics. Twenty-four participants verified their (Formula presented.) O2max in the verification test. Ten of them showed a plateau in the individualized ramp test. VO2DEF at the end of this ramp test (4.34 ± 0.60 vs 4.54 ± 0.43 L) was not different between the plateau and the non-plateau group (P > 0.05). The plateau group had a significantly (P < 0.05) lower VO2DEF 2 minutes before termination of the individualized ramp test (2.24 ± 0.40 vs 2.78 ± 0.33 L). This coincided with a shorter mean response time (43 ± 9 vs 53 ± 7 seconds), a higher increase in (Formula presented.)

abstract = {Hypogravity treadmills have become a popular training tool in distance running and triathlon. Counter-intuitively, tibial acceleration load is not attenuated by hypogravity unloading during running, while, equally surprisingly, leaps become flatter instead of higher. To explain these effects from a biomechanical perspective, Polet, Schroeder, and Bertram (2017) recently developed an energetic model for hypogravity running and validated it with recreational athletes at a constant jogging speed. The present study was conducted to refine that model for competitive athletes at relevant running speeds of 12-22 km h-1 and gravity levels of 100 %, 80 % and 60 %. Based on new experimental data on 15 well-Trained runners in treadmill tests until volitional exhaustion, the enhanced semi-empirical model well describes energy expenditure and the observed biomechanical effects of hypogravity running. Remarkably, anaerobic contributions led to an increase in energy cost per meter for speeds above 16-18 km h-1 (p < 0.001), irrespective of hypogravity unloading. Moreover, some converging trends were observed that might reflect general adaptations in running motor control for optimization of efficiency. In essence, the outcome of this research might help sports scientists and practitioners to design running programs for specific training stimuli, e.g. conditioning of anaerobic energy metabolism.},

abstract = {The maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) depicts the highest blood lactate concentration (BLC) that can be maintained over time without a continual accumulation at constant prolonged workload. In cycling, no difference in the MLSS was combined with lower power output related to peak workload (IMLSS) at 100 than at 50 rpm. MLSS coincides with a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) close to 1. Recently, at incremental exercise, an RER of 1 was found at similar workload and similar intensity but higher BLC at 100 than at 50 rpm. Therefore, the authors reassessed a potential effect of cycling cadences on the MLSS and tested the hypothesis that the MLSS would be higher at 105 than at 60 rpm with no difference in IMLSS in a between-subjects design (n = 16, age 25.1 ± 1.9 y, height 178.4 ± 6.5 cm, body mass 70.3 ± 6.5 kg vs n = 16, 23.6 ± 3.0 y, 181.4 ± 5.6 cm, 72.5 ± 6.2 kg; study I) and confirmed these findings in a within-subject design (n = 12, 25.3 ± 2.1 y, 175.9 ± 7.7 cm, 67.8 ± 8.9 kg; study II). In study I, the MLSS was lower at 60 than at 105 rpm (4.3 ± 0.7 vs 5.4 ± 1.0 mmol/L; P = .003) with no difference in IMLSS (68.7% ± 5.3% vs 71.8% ± 5.9%). Study II confirmed these findings on MLSS (3.4 ± 0.8 vs 4.5 ± 1.0 mmol/L; P = .001) and IMLSS (65.0% ± 6.8% vs 63.5% ± 6.3%; P = .421). The higher MLSS at 105 than at 60 rpm combined with an invariance of IMLSS and RER close to 1 at MLSS supports the hypothesis that higher cadences can induce a preservation of carbohydrates at given BLC levels during low-intensity, high-volume training sessions.},

abstract = {Critical power (CP) and the second ventilatory threshold (VT2) are presumed to indicate the power corresponding to maximal lactate steady state (MLSS). The aim of this study was to investigate the use of CP and VT2 as indicators of MLSS. Eleven male trained subjects [mean (SD) age 23 (2.9) years] performed an incremental test (25 W{\textperiodcentered}min-1) to determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), maximal aerobic power (MAP) and the first and second ventilatory thresholds (VT1 and VT2) associated with break points in minute ventilation (VE), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), VE/VCO2 and VE/VO2 relationships. Exhaustion tests at 90%, 95%, 100% and 110% of VO2max and several 30-min constant work rates were performed in order to determine CP and MLSS, respectively. MAP and VO2max values were 344 (29) W and 53.4 (3.7) ml{\textperiodcentered} min-1{\textperiodcentered}kg-1, respectively. CP [278 (22) W; 85.4 (4.8)% VO2max] and VT2 power output [286 (28) W; 85.3 (5.6)% ̇VO2max] were not significantly different (p = 0.96) but were higher (p < 0.05) than the MLSS work rate [239 (21) W; 74.3 (4.0)% VO2max] and VT1 power output [159 (23) W; 52.9 (6.9)% VO2max]. MLSS work rate was significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with those noted at VT1 and VT2 (r=0.74 and r=0.93, respectively). VT2 overestimated MLSS by 10.9 (6.3)% VO2max which was significantly higher than VT1 [+21.4 (5.6)% VO2max; p<0.01]. CP calculated from a given range of exhaustion times does not correspond to MLSS.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare optimal pedalling velocities during maximal (OVM) and submaximal (OVSM) cycling in human, subjects with different training backgrounds. A group of 22 subjects [6 explosive (EX), 6 endurance (EN) and 10 non-specialised subjects] sprint cycled on a friction-loaded ergometer four maximal sprints lasting 6 s each followed by five 3-min periods of steady-state cycling at 150 W with pedalling frequencies varying from 40 to 120 rpm. The OVM and OVSM were defined as the velocities corresponding to the maximal power production and the lowest oxygen consumption, respectively. A significant linear relationship (r2 = 0.52, P < 0.001) was found between individual OVM [mean 123.1 (SD 11.2) rpm] and OVSM [mean 57.0 (SD 4.9) rpm, P < 0.001] values, suggesting that the same functional properties of leg extensor muscles influence both OVM and OVSM. Since EX was greater than EN in both OVM and OVSM (134.3 compared to 110.9 rpm and 60.8 compared to 54.0 rpm, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) it could be hypothesised that the distribution of muscle fibre type plays an important role in optimising both maximal and submaximal cycling performance.},

abstract = {We present a method for quantifying the anaerobic capacity based on determination of the maximal accumulated O2 deficit. The accumulated O2 deficit was determined for 11 subjects during 5 exhausting bouts of treadmill running lasting from 15 s to >4 min. The accumulated O2 deficit increased with the duration for exhausting bouts lasting up to 2 min, but a leveling off was found for bouts lasting 2 min or more. Between subject variation in the maximal accumulated O2 deficit ranged from 52 to 90 ml/kg. During exhausting exercise while subjects inspired air with reduced O2 content (O2 fraction = 13.5%), the maximal O2 uptake was 22% lower, whereas the accumulated O2 deficit remained unchanged. The precision of the method is 3 ml/kg. The method is based on estimation of the O2 demand by extrapolating the linear relationship between treadmill speed and O2 uptake at submaximal intensities. The slopes, which reflect running economy, varied by 16% between subjects, and the relationships had to be determined individually. This can be done either by measuring the O2 uptake at a minimum of 10 different submaximal intensities or by two measurements close to the maximal O2 uptake and by making use of a common Y-intercept of 5 ml{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1. By using these individual relationships the maximal accumulated O2 deficit, which appears to be a direct quantitative expression of the anaerobic capacity, can be calculated after measuring the O2 uptake during one exhausting bout of exercise lasting 2-3 min.},

abstract = {The development of simple, noninvasive tests of work capacities, underpinned primarily by anaerobic metabolism, proliferated in the early 1970s. A 30-second maximal cycle test developed at the Wingate Institute initiated efforts to develop work tests of anaerobic capacities. Such tests can be developed using any ergometer which simulates competitive conditions and enables an accurate determination of mechanical work output. A 10-second all-out test is commonly used to measure maximal work output generated primarily via the hydrolysis of high-energy Phosphagens (i.e. the alactic work capacity). In contrast, a variety of constant-load and all-out tests of anaerobic (alactic plus lactic) work capacity have been proposed. It has been suggested that all-out tests provide more information about physiological capabilities and are easier to apply than constant-load tests. The optimal duration for an all-out test of anaerobic work capacity is proposed at 30 seconds, a duration which may also provide the basis for the development of accurate field tests of anaerobic capacity. There is evidence that the y-intercept of the maximal work-derivation regression is a valid work estimate of anaerobic capacity in athletes, although its utility is undermined by the number of tests required for its derivation. {\textcopyright} 1995, Adis International Limited.

abstract = {To examine the anaerobic energy release during intense exercise, 16 healthy young men cycled as long as possible at constant powers chosen to exhaust the subjects in $\sim$30 s, 1 min, or 2-3 min. Muscle biopsies were taken before and $\sim$10 s after exercise and analyzed for lactate, phosphocreatine (PCr), and other metabolites. O2 uptake was measured for determination of the accumulated O2 deficit (a whole body measure of the anaerobic energy release), and this indirect measure of the anaerobic energy release was compared with a direct value obtained from measured muscle metabolites. Muscle lactate concentration rose by 30.0 ± 1.2 mmol/kg and muscle PCr concentration fell by 12.4 ± 0.9 mmol/kg during the 2-3 min of exhausting exercise. The anaerobic ATP production was consequently 58 ± 2 mmol/kg wet muscle mass, which may be the maximum anaerobic energy release for human muscle during bicycling. Because the anaerobic ATP production was 6 and 32% less for 1 min and 30 s of exercise, respectively, than for 2 min of exercise (P < 0.03), 2 min of exhausting exercise may be required for maximal use of anaerobic sources. Lactate production provided three times more ATP than PCr breakdown for all three exercise durations. There was a close linear relationship between the rates of anaerobic ATP production in muscle and the value estimated for the whole body by the O2 deficit (r = 0.94). This suggests that the accumulated O2 deficit is a valid measure of the anaerobic energy release during bicycling.},

abstract = {The maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) is the highest blood lactate concentration (BLC) that can be identified as maintaining a steady-state during a prolonged submaximal constant workload. Comparative interpretation of published data about MLSS is complicated by the fact that different methods of testing have been utilized. Thus, three methods, corresponding to the time course of changes in BLC incurred during either 30 min (MLSS I) or 20 min (MLSS II and III) of constant submaximal workload exercise, were compared in 26 male subjects [mean (SD) age 24.6 (5.6) years, height 181.6 (4.9) cm, body mass 74.4 (5.2) kg]. MLSS I [5.1 (1.3) mmol{\textperiodcentered}l-1], II [4.9 (1.3) mmol{\textperiodcentered}l-1], and III [4.3 (1.3) mmol{\textperiodcentered}l-1] were different (P < 0.01). The workload corresponding to MLSS III [244.8 (44.0) W] was lower (P < 0.01) than that at MLSS I [254.0 (40.8) W] and II [251.9 (40.4) W]. No difference could be confirmed between the workloads established for MLSS I and MLSS II. The differences between MLSS I, MLSS II, and MLSS III and corresponding workloads reflect insufficient contribution to lactate kinetics by testing procedures that depend strongly upon the time course of changes in BLC during the initial 20-25 min of constant-workload exercise. Based on the present findings, constant-load tests lasting at least 30 min and a BLC increase of no more than 1.0 mmol{\textperiodcentered}l-1 after the 10th testing minute appear to be the most reasonable with respect to valid testing results.},

abstract = {Background and Objectives: This study aimed to compare the calculated running velocity at the anaerobic lactate threshold (cLTAn), determined by a mathematical model for metabolic simulation, with two established threshold concepts (onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA; 4 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L−1) and modified maximal deviation method (mDmax)). Additionally, all threshold concepts were correlated with performance in different endurance running events. Materials and Methods: Ten sub-elite runners performed a 30 s sprint test on a cycle ergometer adjusted to an isokinetic mode set to a cadence of 120 rpm to determine maximal lactate production rate (VLamax), and a graded exercise test on a treadmill to determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). Running velocities at OBLA, mDmax, and cLTAn were then compared with each other, and further correlated with running performance over various distances (3000 m, 5000 m, and 10,000 m). Results: The mean difference in cLTAn was −0.13 ± 0.43 m{\textperiodcentered}s−1 and −0.32 ± 0.39 m{\textperiodcentered}s−1 compared to mDmax (p = 0.49) and OBLA (p < 0.01), respectively. cLTAn indicated moderate to good concordance with the established threshold concepts (mDmax: ICC = 0.87, OBLA: ICC = 0.74). In comparison with other threshold concepts, cLTAn exhibited comparable correlations with the assessed running performances (cLTAn: r = 0.61–0.76, mDmax: r = 0.69–0.79, OBLA: r = 0.56–0.69). Conclusion: Our data show that cLTAn can be applied for determining endurance performance during running. Due to the consideration of individual physiological profiles, cLTAn offers a physiologically justified approach to assess an athlete's endurance performance.},

abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was the comparison of the calculated (MLSS C ) and experimental power (MLSS E ) in maximal lactate steady-state (MLSS) during cycling. Methods. 13 male subjects (24.2 ± 4.76 years, 72.9 ± 6.9 kg, 178.5 ± 5.9 cm, V ̇ O 2 max: 60.4 ± 8.6 ml min -1 kg -1 , V ̇ La max: 0.9 ± 0.19 mmol l -1 s -1 ) performed a ramp-test for determining the V ̇ O 2 max and a 15 s sprint-test for measuring the maximal glycolytic rate (V ̇ La max). All tests were performed on a Lode-Cycle-Ergometer. V ̇ O 2 max and V ̇ La max were used to calculate MLSS C . For the determination of MLSS E several 30 min constant load tests were performed. MLSS E was defined as the highest workload that can be maintained without an increase of blood-lactate-concentration (BLC) of more than 0.05 mmol l -1 min -1 during the last 20 min. Power in following constant-load test was set higher or lower depending on BLC. Results: MLSS E and MLSS C were measured respectively at 217 ± 51 W and 229 ± 47 W, while mean difference was -12 ± 20 W. Orthogonal regression was calculated with r = 0.92 (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The difference of 12 W can be explained by the biological variability of V ̇ O 2 max and V ̇ La max. The knowledge of both parameters, as well as their individual influence on MLSS, could be important for establishing training recommendations, which could lead to either an improvement in V ̇ O 2 max or V ̇ La max by performing high intensity or low intensity exercise training, respectively. Furthermore the validity of V ̇ La max -test should be focused in further studies. {\textcopyright} 2014Hauser et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Testing procedures for the assessment of anaerobic energy metabolism during muscular work have not yet gained the relevance of tests assessing maximal aerobic power. The diagnosis of aerobic power allows one, through the choice of an adequate testing protocol, to design a test that mainly measures the power of aerobic metabolism by means of indicators like VO2max and lactate. With regard to tests for the assessment of anaerobic power and capacity, however, alactic, lactic, and oxidative components of energy expenditure as a whole cannot be differentiated by means of simple parameters (e.g., lactate and time until exhaustion). By means of computer simulations of energy metabolism for supramaximal loads with durations until exhaustion of about 10 s and 60 s as well as the isolated variation of the concentration of muscle phosphocreatine, the maximal rate of lactate production, and the maximal aerobic power (VO2max), the influence of the single components on energy metabolism as a whole is presented in a semi-quantitative way. Subsequent testing procedures for the measurement of alactic and lactic power as well as alactic and lactic capacity are presented. Finally critical-power method and method for the determination of maximal accumulated O2 deficit are described in greater detail, because both methods are widely discussed in contemporary international literature. {\textcopyright} 2003 by Human Kinetics Publishers and the European College of Sport Science.},

abstract = {Muscular exercise requires transitions to and from metabolic rates often exceeding an order of magnitude above resting and places prodigious demands on the oxidative machinery and O2-transport pathway. The science of kinetics seeks to characterize the dynamic profiles of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and muscular systems and their integration to resolve the essential control mechanisms of muscle energetics and oxidative function: a goal not feasible using the steady-state response. Essential features of the O2 uptake (V̇O2) kinetics response are highly conserved across the animal kingdom. For a given metabolic demand, fast V̇O2 kinetics mandates a smaller O2 deficit, less substrate-level phosphorylation and high exercise tolerance. By the same token, slow V̇ O2 kinetics incurs a high O2 deficit, presents a greater challenge to homeostasis and presages poor exercise tolerance. Compelling evidence supports that, in healthy individuals walking, running, or cycling upright, VO2 kinetics control resides within the exercising muscle(s) and is therefore not dependent upon, or limited by, upstream O2-transport systems. However, disease, aging, and other imposed constraints may redistribute V̇ O2 kinetics control more proximally within the O2-transport system. Greater understanding of V̇ O2 kinetics control and, in particular, its relation to the plasticity of the O2-transport/utilization system is considered important for improving the human condition, not just in athletic populations, but crucially for patients suffering from pathologically slowed V̇ O2 kinetics as well as the burgeoning elderly population. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physiological Society.},

At a combustion rate of about 3 g carbohydrate per minute (RQ around 0.9 or higher) and at average values for glycogen in resting muscle of 1.6 (1.1–2.5)g/100 wet muscle, the effective work time was around 85 min for the untrained and 90 min for the trained subjects.

A close relationship between utilized glycogen and combusted carbohydrate was found, and it seems highly probable that at high relative workloads primarily the glycogen stores in the exercising muscles will limit the capacity for prolonged strenuous work. {\textcopyright} 1967 Scandinavian Physiological Society},

abstract = {In 1968, Saltin et al. published a landmark paper describing the alterations in VO2max resulting from two sequential interventions - 20 days of bed rest and almost 8 weeks of training. They concluded that bed rest reduced VO2max through reductions in maximal cardiac output, while training enhanced VO2max by an equal combination of increased maximal cardiac output and increased arterio-venous [O2] difference (A-V $\Delta$ [O2]). At the time, A-V $\Delta$ [O2] was taken as an index of peripheral (skeletal muscle) adaptation. A key interpretive element that was not featured was consideration of how alterations in cardiac output affect the O2 extraction process secondary to changes in red cell transit time through the muscle microcirculation, even in the absence of adaptive changes in the skeletal muscles per se. For the 2015 Saltin Symposium, it was therefore thought appropriate to re-examine the 1968 O2 transport data and re-evaluate the roles central cardiovascular and peripheral muscle changes after bed rest and training allowing for their interaction. The analysis supports the conclusion that bed rest reduced VO2max mainly through reduction in cardiac output, but after training, it is proposed that the 1968 conclusions should be modified: the majority of the increase in VO2max from the control state can be attributed to an improvement in diffusive unloading of O2 from the muscle microcirculation, with a much smaller role for enhanced blood flow.},

Methods: Fourteen aerobically-trained male cyclists (VO2max 62.1±4.6 ml{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1) performed two graded exercise tests (50Wwarm-up followed by 25W min-1) to exhaustion. Blood lactate, VO2 and VCO2 data were collected at every stage.Workloads at VT1 (rise in VE=VO2;) and VT2 (rise in VE=VCO2) were compared with workloads at lactate thresholds. Several continuous tests were needed to detect the MLSS workload. Agreement and differences among tests were assessed with ANOVA, ICC and Bland-Altman. Reliability of each test was evaluated using ICC, CV and Bland-Altman plots. Results: Workloads at lactate threshold (LT) and LT+2.0 mMol{\textperiodcentered}L-1 matched the ones for VT1 and VT2, respectively (p = 0.147 and 0.539; r = 0.72 and 0.80; Bias = -13.6 and 2.8, respectively). Furthermore, workload at LT+0.5 mMol{\textperiodcentered}L-1 coincided with MLSS workload (p = 0.449; r = 0.78; Bias = -4.5). Lactate threshold tests had high reliability (CV = 3.4-3.7%; r = 0.85-0.89; Bias = -2.1-3.0) except for DMAX method (CV = 10.3%; r = 0.57; Bias = 15.4). Ventilatory thresholds show high reliability (CV = 1.6%-3.5%; r = 0.90-0.96; Bias = -1.8-2.9) except for RER = 1 and V-Slope (CV = 5.0-6.4%; r = 0.79; Bias = -5.6-12.4). Conclusions: Lactate threshold tests can be a valid and reliable alternative to ventilatory thresholds to identify the workloads at the transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism.},

abstract = {Efforts to understand human physiology through the study of champion athletes and  record performances have been ongoing for about a century. For endurance sports three main factors--maximal oxygen consumption (.VO(2,max)), the so-called 'lactate threshold' and efficiency (i.e. the oxygen cost to generate a given running speed or cycling power output)--appear to play key roles in endurance performance. and lactate threshold interact to determine the 'performance .VO(2)' which is the oxygen consumption that can be sustained for a given period of time. Efficiency interacts with the performance .VO(2) to establish the speed or power that can be generated at this oxygen consumption. This review focuses on what is currently known about how these factors interact, their utility as predictors of elite performance, and areas where there is relatively less information to guide current thinking. In this context, definitive ideas about the physiological determinants of running and cycling efficiency is relatively lacking in comparison with .VO(2,max) and the lactate threshold, and there is surprisingly limited and clear information about the genetic factors that might pre-dispose for elite performance. It should also be cautioned that complex motivational and sociological factors also play important roles in who does or does not become a champion and these factors go far beyond simple physiological explanations. Therefore, the performance of elite athletes is likely to defy the types of easy explanations sought by scientific reductionism and remain an important puzzle for those interested in physiological integration well into the future.},

abstract = {Purpose: To analyze the energetic profile of the Basketball Exercise Simulation Test (BEST). Methods: Ten male elite junior basketball players (age 15.5 [0.6] y, height 180 [9] cm, and body mass 66.1 [11.2] kg) performed a modified BEST (20 circuits consisting of jumping, sprinting, jogging, shuffling, and short breaks) simulating professional basketball game play. Circuit time, sprint time, sprint decrement, oxygen uptake (VO2), heart rate, and blood lactate concentration (blc) were obtained. Metabolic energy and metabolic power above rest (Wtot and Ptot), as well as energy share in terms of aerobic (Waer), glycolytic (Wblc), and high-energy phosphates (WPCr), were calculated from VO2 during exercise, net lactate production, and the fast component of postexercise VO2 kinetics, respectively. Results: Waer, Wblc, and WPCr reflect 89% (2%), 5% (1%), and 6% (1%) of total energy needed, respectively. Assuming an aerobic replenishment of PCr energy stores during short breaks, the adjusted energy share yielded Waer 66% (4%), Wblc 5% (1%), and WPCr 29% (1%). Waer and WPCr were negatively correlated (−0.72 and −0.59) with sprint time, which was not the case for Wblc. Conclusions: Consistent with general findings on energy system interaction during repeated high-intensity exercise bouts, the intermittent profile of the BEST relies primarily on aerobic energy combined with repetitive supplementation by anaerobic utilization of high-energy phosphates.},

abstract = {The maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) and the critical power (CP) are two widely used indices of the highest oxidative metabolic rate that can be sustained during continuous exercise and are often considered to be synonymous. However, while perhaps having similarities in principle, methodological differences in the assessment of these parameters typically result in MLSS occurring at a somewhat lower power output or running speed and exercise at CP being sustainable for no more than approximately 20–30 min. This has led to the view that CP overestimates the ‘actual' maximal metabolic steady state and that MLSS should be considered the ‘gold standard' metric for the evaluation of endurance exercise capacity. In this article we will present evidence consistent with the contrary conclusion: i.e., that (1) as presently defined, MLSS naturally underestimates the actual maximal metabolic steady state; and (2) CP alone represents the boundary between discrete exercise intensity domains within which the dynamic cardiorespiratory and muscle metabolic responses to exercise differ profoundly. While both MLSS and CP may have relevance for athletic training and performance, we urge that the distinction between the two concepts/metrics be better appreciated and that comparisons between MLSS and CP, undertaken in the mistaken belief that they are theoretically synonymous, is discontinued. CP represents the genuine boundary separating exercise in which physiological homeostasis can be maintained from exercise in which it cannot, and should be considered the gold standard when the goal is to determine the maximal metabolic steady state.},

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, we (i.e. Hermann Heck and co-workers) developed a direct test to determine the MLSS to investigate whether it occurred at a lactate concentration of 4 mmol.L− 1, as earlier predicted by Alois Mader and colleagues. The test consisted of each participant performing several constant-intensity running bouts of ≈ 30 min at intensities close to the estimated MLSS. During each run, we measured lactate every 5 min. Based on the results, we defined the MLSS as the “workload where the concentration of blood lactate does not increase more than 1 mmo.L− 1during the last 20 min of a constant load exercise”. This MLSS protocol is impractical for performance testing as it requires too many exercise bouts, but it is a gold standard to determine the real MLSS. It is especially useful to validate indirect tests that seek to estimate the MLSS.},

Highly significant correlations with the work rate of the exercise preceding the recovery were found for all the parameters of the fitted equation. The two velocity constants show inverse linear relationships, whereas the other parameters vary according to a definite power function. A functional meaning has been given to the two velocity constants, namely the ability of the tissues to exchange and to remove lactate. For the group of subjects studied, after exercises at work rates below about 3.5 W/kg, the tissue's ability to utilize, and possibly to exchange lactate, increases over values generally reported for resting conditions, whereas after exercises at higher work rates the inverse occurs. Lactate kinetics during recovery appear to be the result of two underlying processes, one enhancing the ability of the tissues to exchange and remove lactate and the other restraining it.},

Most studies measuring pedal forces have been restricted to one leg but a few studies have reported bilateral asymmetry in pedal forces. Pedal force effectiveness is increased at higher power output and reduced at higher pedaling cadences. Changes in saddle position resulted in unclear effects in pedal force effectiveness, while lowering the upper body reduced pedal force effectiveness. Cycling experience and fatigue had unclear effects on pedal force effectiveness. Augmented feedback of pedal forces can improve pedal force effectiveness within a training session and after multiple sessions for cyclists and non-cyclists. No differences in pedal force effectiveness were evident between summarized and instantaneous feedback. Conversely, economy/efficiency seems to be reduced when cyclists are instructed to improve pedal force effectiveness during acute intervention studies involving one session. Decoupled crank systems effectively improved pedal force effectiveness with conflicting effects on economy/efficiency and performance.},

abstract = {The effect of elevated human muscle temperature on energy turnover was investigated during cycling exercise (at 85% of V̇O2max) at a contraction frequency of 60 revs min-1. Muscle temperature was passively elevated prior to exercise by immersion of the legs in a hot water bath (42°C). During exercise at this low pedalling rate, total energy turnover was higher (P<0.05) when muscle temperature was elevated compared with normal temperature (70.4±3.7 versus 66.9±2.4 kJ min-1, respectively). Estimated net mechanical efficiency was found to be lower when muscle temperature was elevated. A second experiment was conducted in which the effect of elevated human muscle temperature on energy turnover was investigated during cycling exercise (at 85% of V̇O2max) at a contraction frequency of 120 revs min-1. Under the conditions of a high pedalling frequency, an elevated muscle temperature resulted in a lower energy turnover (P<0.05) compared with the normal muscle temperature (64.9±3.7 versus 69.0±4.7 kJ min-1, respectively). The estimated net mechanical efficiency was therefore higher when muscle temperature was elevated. We propose that, in these experiments, prior heating results in an inappropriately fast rate of cross-bridge cycling when exercising at 60 revs min-1, leading to an increased energy turnover and decreased efficiency. However, at the faster pedalling rate, the effect of heating the muscle shifts the efficiency/velocity relationship to the right so that cross-bridge detachment is more appropriately matched to the contraction velocity and, hence, energy turnover is reduced.},

The instrumentation system is unique in that for the first time it allows measurement of handlebar and seat loads. With three test subjects riding on rollers, which simulate actual bicycling, loading data were recorded at constant power for different pedaling rates. Analysis of the data enables load characteristics of all three sources (i.e., pedal, seat, and handlebar) to be categorized as being either subject and pedaling rate independent or subject independent but pedaling rate dependent. A complete set of loading data for one subject is presented to illustrate these characteristics. One interesting finding is that peak levels of all but one of the pedal loads are inversely related to pedaling rate. Peak levels of seat and handlebar loads reactive to the driving loads on the pedals, however, are directly related to pedaling rate. Another interesting result is that handlebar and seat loads, except for the lateral seat moment, go through two cycles for each revolution of the crank arm. The interpretation of these results, as well as others, provides insight into the biomechanics of the pedaling process.},

One respect was that the maximum magnitude normal pedal force reached substantially higher values, exceeding the weight of the subject, and the phase occurred later in the crank cycle. Another respect was that the direction of the handlebar forces alternated indicating that the arms pulled up and back during the power stroke of the corresponding leg and pushed down and forward during the upstroke. Inasmuch as these forces were coordinated (i.e., in phase) with the leaning of the bicycle, the arms developed positive power.},

The mechanical power spent to accelerate the limbs relative to the trunk in level walking and running, W(int), has been measured at various ;constant' speeds (3-33 km/hr) with the cinematographic procedure used by Fenn (1930a) at high speeds of running.2. W(int) increases approximately as the square of the speed of walking and running. For a given speed W(int) is greater in walking than in running.3. In walking above 3 km/hr, W(int) is greater than the power spent to accelerate and lift the centre of mass of the body at each step, W(ext) (measured by Cavagna, Thys & Zamboni, 1976b). In running W(int) < W(ext) up to about 20 km/hr, whereas at higher speeds W(int) > W(ext).4. The total work done by the muscles was calculated as W(tot) = W(int) + W(ext). Except that at the highest speeds of walking, the total work done per unit distance W(tot)/km is greater in running than in walking.5. The efficiency of positive work was measured from the ratio W(tot)/Net energy expenditure: this is greater than 0.25 indicating that both in walking and in running the muscles utilize, during shortening, some energy stored during a previous phase of negative work (stretching).6. In walking the efficiency reaches a maximum (0.35-0.40) at intermediate speeds, as may be expected from the properties of the contractile component of muscle. In running the efficiency increases steadily with speed (from 0.45 to 0.70-0.80) suggesting that positive work derives mainly from the passive recoil of muscle elastic elements and to a lesser extent from the active shortening of the contractile machinery. These findings are consistent with the different mechanics of the two exercises.},

abstract = {The mechanical efficiency of cycling with a new pedal-crank prototype (PP) was investigated during an incremental test on a stationary cycloergometer. The efficiency values were compared with those obtained, in the same experimental conditions and with the same subjects, by using a standard pedal-crank system (SP). The main feature of this prototype is that its pedal-crank length changes as a function of the crank angle being maximal during the pushing phase and minimal during the recovery one. This variability was expected to lead to a decrease in the energy requirement of cycling since, for any given thrust, the torque exerted by the pushing leg is increased while the counter-torque exerted by the contra-lateral one is decreased. Whereas no significant differences were found between the two pedal-cranks at low exercise intensities (ẇ=50-200W), at 250-300W the oxygen uptake (V̇O2, W) was found to be significantly lower and the efficiency ($\eta$=ẇ/V̇O2) about 2% larger (p<0.05, Wilcoxon test) in the case of PP. Even if the measured difference in efficiency was rather small, it can be calculated that an athlete riding a bicycle equipped with the patented pedal-crank could improve his 1h record by about 1km. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {It is known that muscular force is reduced in old age. We investigate what are the effects of this phenomenon on the mechanics of running. We hypothesized that the deficit in force would result in a lower push, causing reduced amplitude of the vertical oscillation, with smaller elastic energy storage and increased step frequency. To test this hypothesis, we measured the mechanical energy of the centre of mass of the body during running in old and young subjects. The amplitude of the oscillation is indeed reduced in the old subjects, resulting in an approximately 20% smaller elastic recovery and a greater step frequency (3.7 versus 2.8Hz, p=1.9×10-5, at 15-17kmh-1). Interestingly, the greater step frequency is due to a lower aerial time, and not to a greater natural frequency of the system, which is similar in old and young subjects (3.6 versus 3.4Hz, p=0.2). Moreover, we find that in the old subjects, the step frequency is always similar to the natural frequency, even at the highest speeds. This is at variance with young subjects who adopt a step frequency lower than the natural frequency at high speeds, to contain the aerobic energy expenditure. Finally, the external work to maintain the motion of the centre of mass is reduced in the old subjects (0.9 versus 1.2Jkg-1m-1, p=5.1×10-6) due to the lower work done against gravity, but the higher step frequency involves a greater internal work to reset the limbs at each step. The net result is that the total work increases with speed more steeply in the old subjects than in young subjects. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {The efficiency of human gait has been the subject of comment and speculation for some time. Biomechanically it has been shown that there are passive energy exchanges within body segments and between adjacent segments. The purposes of this paper were to measure and calculate how much of the segment energy changes can be attributed to muscular activity versus these passive exchange mechanisms, and to calculate the mechanical efficiency of overground walking based on the internal mechanical work. Six male subjects, matched for age, height and weight, were analysed during level treadmill walking at an average velocity of 1-54 -1 and a step length of 0-79m using an 11 segment planar biomechanical model. It was determined that the rate of doing internal work, both positive and negative, was about 165 W although the total observed work rate was 500 W. The rate of passive energy exchange within and between segments was 335 W. These results indicate that about two-thirds of the observed mechanical energy changes are conserved in normal gait, with muscle activity accounting for only one-third of these energy changes. Based on the internal mechanical work and metabolic measures the net mechanical efficiency was calculated to be 65% Assuming that negative work was three times as efficient as positive work the efficiencies were calculated to be 130% and 43.3% respectively. {\textcopyright} 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The work done at each step during level walking and running to lift the centre of mass of the body, Wv, and to increase its forward speed, Wf, and the total mechanical energy involved (potential + kinetic) Wext, have been measured at various 'constant' speeds (2‐32 km/hr) with the technique described by Cavagna (1975). 2. At intermediate speeds of walking (about 4 km/hr) Wv = Wf and Wext/km is at a minimum, as is the energy cost. At lower speeds Wv greater than Wf whereas at higher speeds Wf greather than Wv: in both cases Wext/km increases. 3. The recovery of mechanical energy, through the pendular motion characteristic of walking, was measured as (/Wv/ + /Wf/ ‐ Wext)/(/Wv/ + /Wf/): it attains a maximum (about 65%) at intermediate speeds. 4. A simple model, assuming that in walking the body rotates as an inverted pendulum over the foot in contact with the ground, fits the experimental data better at intermediate speeds but is no longer tenable above 7 km/hr. 5. In running the recovery defined above is minimal (0‐4% independent of speed), i.e. Wext congruent to /Wv/ + /Wf/: potential and kinetic energy of the body do not interchange but are simultaneously taken up and released by the muscles with a rate increasing markedly with the speed (from about 1 to 4 h.p.). 6. Wext increases linearly with the running speed Vf from a positive y intercept owing to the fact that Wv is practically constant independent of Vf. On the contrary, Wf = aVf2/(1 + bVf), where b is the ratio between the time spent in the air and the forward distance covered while on the ground during each step. {\textcopyright} 1976 The Physiological Society},

abstract = {Aim. The purpose of this study was to compare work efficiency values (WE = work accomplished/energy expenditure above exercising with 0 load) among different unloaded base-line correction techniques for different power outputs. Methods. Twelve healthy men performed 6 5-min steady-state exercises of 0 (unloaded), 40, 80, 120, 160 and 200 W at a pedalling rate of 90 rpm on a cycle ergometer. Three different unloaded base-line corrections were used for WE calculation: an actual measurement of V̇O2 corresponding to the unloaded pedalling exercise, the y-intercept value of the linear regression between V̇O2 and power output and the y-intercept value of the curvilinear V̇O2-power regression. Results. The present study demonstrated that WE was significantly higher when determined using the actual measurement of the unloaded V̇O2 than y-intercept values of the linear (p<0.001) and curvilinear (p<0.05) V̇O2-power regressions. WE based on theoretical determinations (linear vs curvilinear regressions) were not significantly different. The power output significantly affected all WE index, with higher WE being measured when the power output was low and lower WE when power output was high. Conclusion. The high WE values determined using the actual V̇O2 measurement could be explained by (i) the additional energy expended to stabilise the body in addition to the energy expenditure of moving the lower limbs without power production and by (ii) the difficulty to experimentally reproduce the unloaded condition. The large range of WE values measured in the present study is due to differences in the procedures used to determine the unloaded V̇O2 (and thus differences in unloaded V̇O2 values) as well as differences in the cycling intensities.},

Ten elite male cyclists completed three 5-min treadmill cycling tests at an inclination of 6.8° with constant individual-based speed resulting in a work intensity close to the aerobic threshold. During the first and third test, the participants used standing position (ST test) and seated position (SE test) or vice versa, whereas in the second test, they made repeated transitions between standing and seated positions every 10 s (RT test). The last 2 min of each test was used to measure the mean values of oxygen uptake (V̇O2) and respiratory exchange ratio, which were used to calculate the metabolic rate (MR) and gross efficiency (GE). Additionally, the blood-lactate concentration before and after (Lapost) each test was determined. One-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine the effect of cycling position on the physiological response. No significant differences between tests were observed for the variables related to aerobic energy expenditure (i.e., V̇O2, MR and GE), whereas the RT test was associated with a significantly lower Lapost compared to the ST and SE tests. Steep uphill cycling, at an intensity close to the aerobic threshold, with repeated transitions between standing and seated positions, did not have a higher oxygen consumption; instead, the blood-lactate concentration was lower during the RT test compared to that under continuous use of either seated or standing position.},

The subjects performed two cycling incremental tests at the pedalling rate of 60 rev x min(-1). The first test, with the power output (PO) increases of 30 W every 3 min, was to determine the maximal oxygen uptake (V'O(2max)) and the power output (PO) at V'O(2max), while the second test (series of 6 minutes bouts of increasing intensity) was to determine energy expenditure (EE (V'O(2))), gross efficiency (GE (V'O(2)/PO)) and delta efficiency (DE($\Delta$V'O(2)/DPO)) during sub-lactate threshold (LT) PO. V'O(2max) was 3.79 ±0.40 L x min(-1) and the PO at V'O(2max) was 288 ±27 W. In order to calculate GE and DE the V'O(2) was expressed in W, by standard calculations. GE measured at 30 W, 60 W, 90 W and 120 W was 11.6 ±1.4%, 17.0 ±1.4%, 19.6 ±1.2% and 21.4 ±1.1%, respectively. DE was 29.8 ±1.9%. The subjects' BM (range 59-87 kg) was positively correlated with V'O(2) at rest (p<0.01) and with the intercept of the linear V'O(2) vs. PO relationship (p<0.01), whereas no correlation was found between BM and the slope of V'O(2) vs. PO. No correlation was found between BM and DE, whereas GE was negatively correlated with BM (p<0.01). GE was also negatively correlated with V'O(2max) and the PO at V'O(2max) (p<0.01). We conclude that: V'O(2) at rest affects GE during moderate-intensity cycling and GE negatively corelates with V'O(2max) and the PO at V'O(2max) in young healthy men.},

Ten elite male cyclists completed three 5-min treadmill cycling tests at an inclination of 6.8° with constant individual-based speed resulting in a work intensity close to the aerobic threshold. During the first and third test, the participants used standing position (ST test) and seated position (SE test) or vice versa, whereas in the second test, they made repeated transitions between standing and seated positions every 10 s (RT test). The last 2 min of each test was used to measure the mean values of oxygen uptake (V̇O2) and respiratory exchange ratio, which were used to calculate the metabolic rate (MR) and gross efficiency (GE). Additionally, the blood-lactate concentration before and after (Lapost) each test was determined. One-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine the effect of cycling position on the physiological response. No significant differences between tests were observed for the variables related to aerobic energy expenditure (i.e., V̇O2, MR and GE), whereas the RT test was associated with a significantly lower Lapost compared to the ST and SE tests. Steep uphill cycling, at an intensity close to the aerobic threshold, with repeated transitions between standing and seated positions, did not have a higher oxygen consumption; instead, the blood-lactate concentration was lower during the RT test compared to that under continuous use of either seated or standing position.},

V'O2max was 3.79 ±0.40 L{\textperiodcentered}min–1 and the PO at V'O2max was 288 ±27 W. In order to calculate GE and DE the V'O2 was expressed in W, by standard calculations.

abstract = {This study examined the contribution of phosphocreatine (PCr) and aerobic metabolism during repeated bouts of sprint exercise. Eight male subjects performed two cycle ergometer sprints separated by 4 min of recovery during two separate main trials. Sprint 1 lasted 30 s during both main trials, whereas sprint 2 lasted either 10 or 30 s. Muscle biopsies were obtained at rest, immediately after the first 30-s sprint, after 3.8 min of recovery, and after the second 10- and 30-s sprints. At the end of sprint 1, PCr was 16.9 +/- 1.4% of the resting value, and muscle pH dropped to 6.69 +/- 0.02. After 3.8 min of recovery, muscle pH remained unchanged (6.80 +/- 0.03), but PCr was resynthesized to 78.7 +/- 3.3% of the resting value. PCr during sprint 2 was almost completely utilized in the first 10 s and remained unchanged thereafter. High correlations were found between the percentage of PCr resynthesis and the percentage recovery of power output and pedaling speed during the initial 10 s of sprint 2 (r = 0.84, P < 0.05 and r = 0.91, P < 0.01). The anaerobic ATP turnover, as calculated from changes in ATP, PCr, and lactate, was 235 +/- 9 mmol/kg dry muscle during the first sprint but was decreased to 139 +/- 7 mmol/kg dry muscle during the second 30-s sprint, mainly as a result of a approximately 45% decrease in glycolysis. Despite this approximately 41% reduction in anaerobic energy, the total work done during the second 30-s sprint was reduced by only approximately 18%. This mismatch between anaerobic energy release and power output during sprint 2 was partly compensated for by an increased contribution of aerobic metabolism, as calculated from the increase in oxygen uptake during sprint 2 (2.68 +/- 0.10 vs. 3.17 +/- 0.13 l/min; sprint 1 vs. sprint 2; P < 0.01). These data suggest that aerobic metabolism provides a significant part (approximately 49%) of the energy during the second sprint, whereas PCr availability is important for high power output during the initial 10 s.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The heart rate, oxygen-debt pay-off, and carbon-dioxide expulsion curves during recovery were established. Comparison of the Active and Passive recovery data showed no difference above their respective levels of return ("Zero" load pedaling or resting), except for substantially slower pay-off of the "lactic" part of the oxygen debt. {\textcopyright} 1969 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Signal averaging was applied and data were analyzed by regression analysis using a first-order exponential model. The time constants for both [PCr] and [Pi] responses to moderate exercise and recovery were not different both within and between nuclei ranging from 32 to 35 s (P > 0.05). The time constants derived from moderate exercise and recovery, when employed to construct predictive equations for heavy exercise and recovery, did not adequately describe [PCr] dynamics. Underestimation of the net hydrolysis of PCr during heavy exercise was associated with increases in [H+] as predicted by the creatine kinase equilibrium reaction (CKeq). Calculation of [ADP] by CKeq revealed steady state [ADP] was achieved during moderate exercise and during recovery for both intensities much earlier than during heavy exercise. We conclude that the metabolic system does not behave as a linear system. Therefore, the time constant and the net change in [PCr].W-1 must themselves be determined by work dependent combinations of other system variables.},

abstract = {The time course of phosphorylcreatine (PC) resynthesis in the human m. quadriceps femoris was studied during recovery from exhaustive dynamic exercise and from isometric contraction sustained to fatigue. The immediate postexercise muscle PC content after either form of exercise was 15-16% of the resting muscle content. The time course of PC resynthesis during recovery was biphasic exhibiting a fast and a slow recovery component. The half-time for the fast component was 21-22 s but this accounted for a smaller fraction of the total PC restored during recovery from the isometric contraction than after the dynamic exercise. The half-time for the slow component was in each case more than 170 s. After 2 and 4 min recovery the total amounts of PC resynthesized after the isometric exercise were significantly lower than from the dynamic exercise. Occlusion of the circulation to the quadriceps completely abolished the resynthesis of PC. Restoration of resynthesis occurred only after release of occlusion. {\textcopyright} 1976 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Muscle metabolism, including the role of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in muscle lactate (Lac-) production, was examined during incremental exercise before and after 7 days of submaximal training on a cycle ergometer [2 h daily at 60% peak O2 uptake (̇O(2max))]. Subjects were studied at rest and during continuous steady-state cycling at three stages (15 min each): 30, 65, and 75% of the pretraining ̇O(2max). Blood was sampled from brachial artery and femoral vein, and leg blood flow was measured by thermodilution. Biopsies of the vastus lateralis were obtained at rest and during steady-state exercise at the end of each stage. ̇O2(max), leg O2 uptake, and the maximum activities of citrate synthase and PDH were not altered by training; muscle glycogen. concentration was higher. During rest and cycling at 30% VO(2max), muscle Lac- concentration ([Lac-]) and leg efflux were similar. At 65% ̇O(2max), muscle [Lac-] was lower (11.9 ± 3.2 vs. 20.0 ± 5.8 mmol/kg dry wt) and Lac- efflux was less [-0.22 ± 0.24 (one leg) vs. 1.42 ± 0.33 mmol/min] after training. Similarly, at 75% ̇O(2max), lower muscle [Lac-] (17.2 ± 4.4 vs. 45.2 ± 6.6 mmol/kg dry wt) accompanied less release (0.41 ± 0.53 vs. 1.32 ± 0.65 mmol/min) after training. PDH in its active form (PDH(a)) was not different between conditions. Calculated pyruvate production at 75% ̇O(2max) fell by 33%, pyruvate reduction to lactate fell by 59%, and pyruvate oxidation fell by 24% compared with before training. Muscle contents of coenzyme A and phosphocreatine were higher during exercise after training. Lower muscle lactate production after training resulted from improved matching of glycolytic and PDH(a) fluxes, independently of changes in muscle O2 consumption, and was associated with greater phosphorylation potential.},

abstract = {The present study examined the acute effects of hypoxia on the regulation of skeletal muscle metabolism at rest and during 15 min of submaximal exercise. Subjects exercised on two occasions for 15 min at 55% of their normoxic maximal oxygen uptake while breathing 11% O3 (hypoxia) or room air (normoxia). Muscle biopsies were taken at rest and after 1 and 15 min of exercise. At rest, no effects on muscle metabolism were observed in response to hypoxia. In the 1st min of exercise, glycogenolysis was significantly greater in hypoxia compared with normoxia. This small difference in glycogenolysis was associated with a tendency toward a greater concentration of substrate, free P(i), in hypoxia compared with normoxia. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (PDH(a)) was lower in hypoxia at 1 min compared with normoxia, resulting in a reduced rate of pyruvate oxidation and a greater lactate accumulation. During the last 14 min of exercise, glycogenolysis was greater in hypoxia despite a lower mole fraction of phosphorylase a. The greater glycogenolytic rate was maintained posttransformationally through significantly higher free [AMP] and [P(i)]. At the end of exercise, PDH(a) was greater in hypoxia compared with normoxia, contributing to a greater rate of pyruvate oxidation. Because of the higher glycogenolytic rate in hypoxia, the rate of pyruvate production continued to exceed the rate of pyruvate oxidation, resulting in significant lactate accumulation in hypoxia compared with no further lactate accumulation in normoxia. Hence, the elevated lactate production associated with hypoxia at the stone absolute workload could in part be explained by the effects of hypoxia on the activities of the rate-limiting enzymes, phosphorylase and PDH, which regulate the rates of pyruvate production and pyruvate oxidation, respectively.},

abstract = {This study compared biochemical and 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) determinations of energy metabolites during isometric contractions of the human calf muscle at various exercise intensities. Seven male subjects performed one-legged isometric contractions at a work load of 28, 64, and 90% of maximal voluntary contraction force (28-, 64-, and 90%-CON, respectively) for 3 min, 40 s, and 40 s, respectively, in a magnet and in an exact model of the magnet with an arrangement for rapid muscle biopsy sampling from the gastrocnemius. The decrease in phosphocreatine (CrP) determined by NMR was 20, 33, and 71% for 28%-, 64%-, and 90%-CON, respectively. These decreases were the same as those determined biochemically (25, 34, and 61%, respectively). Muscle CrP 1 min after 90%-CON was also found to be similar between NMR and biochemical determinations (88 and 74% of resting value, respectively). Although no significant change in muscle ATP was found by NMR, a decrease of 29% was observed biochemically at 90%-CON. The ratio between muscle CrP and ATP was the same between NMR and biochemical determinations except for 90%-CON (1.98 and 0.78, respectively). The increase in muscle ADP determined by NMR was two-, five-, and eightfold higher than that found biochemically for 28%-, 64%-, and 90%-CON, respectively. This was related to the change in muscle inosine monophosphate concentration (r = 0.61, P < 0.05). The present data suggest that biochemical measurements and NMR spectroscopy provide the same information on muscle CrP during isometric muscle contractions. This also appears to be true for muscle ATP, with the exception of measurements during muscle contractions at high work loads. The more pronounced increase in muscle ADP determined by NMR compared with that determined by biochemical measurements is consistent with free ADP being a major modulator of muscle metabolism during muscle contractions.},

abstract = {1. In vivo ATP synthesis rates were measured in the human medial gastrocnemius muscle during high intensity exercise using localized 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS). Six-second localized spectra were acquired during and following a 30 s maximal voluntary rate exercise using a magnetic resonance image-guided spectral localization technique. 2. During 30 s maximal voluntary rate exercise, ATPase fluxes were predominantly met by anaerobic ATP sources. Maximal in vivo glycogenolytic rates of 207 ± 48 mM ATP min-1 were obtained within 15 s, decreasing to 72 ± 34 mM ATP min-1 by the end of 30 s. In contrast, aerobic ATP synthesis rates achieved 85 ± 2% of their maximal capacity within 9 s and did not change throughout the exercise. The ratio of peak glycolytic ATP synthesis rate to maximal oxidative ATP synthesis was 2.9 ± 0.9. 3. The non-P(i), non-CO2 buffer capacity was calculated to be 27.0 ± 6.2 slykes (millimoles acid added per unit change in pH). At the cessation of exercise, P(i), phosphomonoesters and CO2 were predicted to account for 17.2 ± 1.5, 5.57 ± 0.97 and 2.24 ± 0.34 slykes of the total buffer capacity. 4. Over the approximately linear range of intracellular pH recovery following the post-exercise acidification, pH(i) recovered at a rate of 0.19 ± 0.03 pH units min-1. Proton transport capacity was determined to be 16.4 ± 4.1 mM (pH unit)-1 min-1 and corresponded to a maximal proton efflux rate of 15.3 ± 2.7 mM min-1. 5. These data support the observation that glycogenolytic and glycolytic rates are elevated in vivo in the presence of elevated P(i) levels. The data do not support the hypothesis that glycogenolysis follows Michealis-Menten kinetics with an apparent K(m) for [P(i)] in vivo. 6. In vivo-measured ATP utilization rates and the initial dependence on PCr and glycolysis were similar to those previously reported in in situ studies involving short duration, high intensity exercise. This experimental approach presents a non-invasive, quantitative measure of peak glycolytic rates in human skeletal muscle.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine a new method for calculating the O2 deficit that considered the O2 uptake (V̇O2) kinetics during exercise as two separate phases in light of previous research in which it was shown that the traditional O2 deficit calculation overestimated the recovery O2 consumption (ROC). Eight subjects completed exercise transitions between unloaded cycling and 25% (heavy, H) or 50% (very heavy, VH) of the difference between the lactic acid threshold (LAT) and peak VEO2 for 8 min. The O2 deficit, calculated in the traditional manner, was significantly greater than the measured ROC for both above-LAT exercises: 4.03 ± 1.01 vs. 2.63 ± 0.80 (SD) liters for VH and 2.36 ± 0.91 vs. 1.74 ± 0.63 liters for H for the O2 deficit vs. ROC (P < 0.05). When the kinetics were viewed as two separate components with independent onsets, the calculated O2 deficit (2.89 ± 0.79 and 1.71 ± 0.70 liters for VH and H, respectively) was not different from the measured ROC (P < 0.05). Subjects also performed the same work rate for only 3 min. These data, from bouts terminated before the slow component could contribute appreciably to the overall V̇O2 response, show that the O2 requirement during the transition is less than the final steady state for the work rate, as evidenced by symmetry between the O2 deficit and ROC. This new method of calculating the O2 deficit more closely reflects the expected O2 deficit-ROC relationship (i.e., ROC ≥ O2 deficit). Therefore, estimation of the O2 deficit during heavy, exercise transitions should consider the slow component of V̇O2 as an additional deficit component with delayed onset.},

Its speed constant has the same value both for work performed in aerobic conditions as for very strenuous exercise involving an energy expenditure higher than can be maintained on the O2 consumption (anaerobic conditions). The half reaction time of this process is about 30 sec. These results support the hypothesis that the intracellular oxidation processes are coupled with the splitting and resynthosis of the high energy phosphate processes in muscle. The speed of oxidative processes in muscle does not seem to be a limiting factor to the oxygen uptake in muscular exercise. The maximum Os consumption level is presumably set by the capacity of the 02 transport from the lungs to the active tissues. {\textcopyright} Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Current methods of oxygen uptake (VO2) kinetics data handling may be too simplistic for the complex physiology involved in the underlying physiological processes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify the VO2 kinetics to steady state across the full range of sub-ventilatory threshold work rates, with a particular focus on the VO2 onset kinetics. Ten healthy, moderately trained males participated in five bouts of cycling. Each bout involved 10 min at a percentage of the subject's ventilation threshold (30, 45, 60, 75, 90%) from unloaded cycling. The VO2 kinetics was quantified using the conventional mono-exponential time constant (tau, $\tau$), as well as the new methods for VO2 onset kinetics. Compared to linear modeling, non-linear modeling caused a deterioration of goodness of fit (main effect, p < 0.001) across all exercise intensities. Remainder kinetics were also improved using a modified application of the mono-exponential model (main effect, p < 0.001). Interestingly, the slope from the linear regression of the onset kinetics data is similar across all subjects and absolute exercise intensities, and thereby independent of subject fitness and t. This could indicate that there are no functional limitations between subjects during this onset phase, with limitations occurring for the latter transition to steady state. Finally, the continuing use of mono-exponential modeling could mask important underlying physiology of more instantaneous VO2 responses to steady state. Consequently, further research should be conducted on this new approach to VO2 onset kinetics.},

abstract = {Research into the rate of whole-body oxygen consumption (VO2) kinetics during exercise increments to low- to moderate-intensity steady-state exercise was originally based on the theory of linear first-order VO2 kinetics, implying that the VO2 response to steady-state exercise increments is a mono-exponential response of the same time constant (tau, $\pi$) across all steady-state intensities. Despite the acceptance of this theory for more than 30 years, early research from the 1980s documented an increasing $\pi$ with increasing steady-state exercise intensity, and recent research has confirmed such results. Today, such evidence has led to retraction of the theory of linear firstorder VO2 kinetics. This history, revealing the premature acceptance of a theory, and subsequent scientific investigation using improved research design, instrumentation and data processing, has important implications for the fragility of scientific theories and the need for continual testing of theories in the search for facts and not prematurely accepted constructs. This review provides historical evidence for a critical reappraisal of the theory of linear first-order VO2 kinetics and presents data to show the need for changes in the data-processing 'standards' of the discipline to improve measurement of instantaneous VO2 kinetics and the time to steady state. For example, to date, no study of VO2 kinetics has quantified and statistically analysed the time to steady state. Furthermore, the instability of $\pi$ across different exercise increments, and for the same increment from different baseline VO2 demand, prevents $\pi$ from being a valid measure of VO2 kinetics for different exercise conditions. The concept of quantifying kinetics from a total non-linear response, when no other field of kinetics pursues this methodology, also raises concern for the methods and models used to interpret steady-state VO2 kinetics. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

Rodr{\'{i}}guez F.A., Mader A.: Energy metabolism during 400 and 100-m crawl swimming: computer simulation based on free swimming measurement. In: Chatard ABSTRACT This study aimed to approach the relative contribution of the energy delivery systems during 400 and 100-m events by simulating the dynamic behaviour of the energy metabolism during swimming on the basis of field metabolic measurements in young competitive swimmers. Ten swimmers of national level (5 M, 5 F) performed a series of five unimpeded 400-m swims (ca. 75-100% V max) and a maximal 100-m swim in a 50-m pool. Oxygen uptake was measured breath-by-breath during the immediate recovery period (Rodr{\'{i}}guez 1999). Blood lactate was analysed in serial capillary samples. Averaged metabolic measurements for every swim were introduced into a computer simulation model (CS) based on a system of differential equations to simulate the dynamics of energy muscle metabolism (Mader et al. 1983; Mader & Heck 1994). The dynamic CS estimations showed that the aerobic energy supply (83.2-85.5 %E tot for 400 m, and 54.1-61.4 % E tot for 100 m, for males and females, respectively) clearly exceeds the values commonly found in the literature for 400 m (ranging from ca. 25-60 %E tot), as well as for 100 m events (ca. 5-20 %E tot). The relatively high maximal aerobic and low glycolytic power of the subjects (most of them middle-distance swimmers) partially accounts for the high contribution of the oxidative sources. However, the relevance of the aerobic contribution to total energy demands should not be underestimated, particularly in young swimmers.},

abstract = {1. A slow component to pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO2) is reported during prolonged high power exercise performed at constant power output at, or above, approximately 60% of the maximal oxygen uptake. The magnitude of the slow component is reported to be associated with the intensity of exercise and to be largely accounted for by an increased VO2 across the exercising legs. 2. On the assumption that the control mechanism responsible for the increased VO2 is intensity dependent we hypothesized that it should also be apparent in multi‐stage incremental exercise tests with the result that the VO2‐power output relationship would be curvilinear. 3. We further hypothesized that the change in the VO2‐power output relationship could be related to the hierarchical recruitment of different muscle fibre types with a lower mechanical efficiency. 4. Six subjects each performed five incremental exercise tests, at pedalling rates of 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 rev min‐1, over which range we expected to vary the proportional contribution of different fibre types to the power output. Pulmonary VO2 was determined continuously and arterialized capillary blood was sampled and analysed for blood lactate concentration ([lactate]b). 5. Below the level at which a sustained increase in [lactate]b was observed pulmonary VO2 showed a linear relationship with power output; at high power outputs, however, there was an additional increase in VO2 above that expected from the extrapolation of that linear relationship, leading to a positive curvilinear VO2‐power output relationship. 6. No systematic effect on the magnitude or onset of the ‘extra' VO2 was found in relation to pedalling rate, which suggests that it is not related to the pattern of motor unit recruitment in any simple way. {\textcopyright} 1995 The Physiological Society},

abstract = {Considerable debate surrounds the issue of whether the rate of adaptation of skeletal muscle O2 consumption (QO2) at the onset of exercise is limited by 1) the inertia of intrinsic cellular metabolic signals and enzyme activation or 2) the availability of O2 to the mitochondria, as determined by an extrinsic inertia of convective and diffusive O2 transport mechanisms. This review critically examines evidence for both hypotheses and clarifies important limitations in the experimental and theoretical approaches to this issue. A review of biochemical evidence suggests that a given respiratory rate is a function of the net drive of phosphorylation potential and redox potential and cellular mitochondrial PO2 (PmitoO2). Changes in both phosphorylation and redox potential are determined by intrinsic metabolic inertia. PmitoO2 is determined by the extrinsic inertia of both convective and diffusive O2 transport mechanisms during the adaptation to exercise and the rate of mitochondrial O2 utilization. In a number of exercise conditions, PmitoO2 appears to be within a range capable of modulating muscle metabolism. Within this context, adjustments in the phosphate energy state of the cell would serve as a cytosolic "transducer," linking ATP consumption with mitochondrial ATP production and, therefore, O2 consumption. The availability of reducing equivalents and O2 would modulate the rate of adaptation of QO2.},

This model is in the form of a set of nonlinear coupled vector fields for the V̇O 2(v,t) and v̇, the derivative of the exercise intensity with respect to time. We also present a new and novel means for calculating the oxygen demand, D(v,t), and hence also the oxygen deficit and debt, given the time series of the V̇O2(v,t). This enables us to give better predictions for these values especially for when exercising at or close to maximal exercise intensities. Our model also allows us to predict the oxygen uptake time series given the time series for the exercise intensity as well as to investigate the oxygen uptake response to nonlinear exercise intensities. Neither of these features is possible using the currently used three-phase model. We also present a review of both the underlying physiology and the three-phase model.

abstract = {Characterizing oxygen uptake (VO2) kinetics yields valuable information regarding both a) the effectiveness of the coupling of O2 delivery to tissue metabolic demands, and b) the ability of the muscle itself to utilize O2 for oxidative phosphorylation. During moderate exercise VO2 reaches a new steady state within 3 min in normal subjects, with little or no sustained rise in blood lactate. The steady state VO2 increases linearly with work rate. The time constant for VO2 in Phase 2 (after first 15-20 s) is constant across work intensities, and appears to reflect muscle oxygen utilization kinetics. However, when heavier exercise is performed, which elevates blood lactate throughout the exercise, the VO2 response becomes more complex. The predominant, Phase 2 response continues to rise exponentially with about the same time constant as for moderate exercise, and the amplitude continues to be linearly related to work rate. However, an additional, slowly developing rise in VO2 is also usually observed, beginning 100-200 s into exercise. This additional VO2 delays attainment of a steady state, increases the overall O2 "cost" of the exercise, and is statistically associated with the rate and magnitude of increase in blood lactate. Interestingly, in children, neither the slow component nor blood lactate rise as much during heavy exercise.},

abstract = {Previous investigators have reported that oxygen consumption (VO2) continues to rise after the initial 2- to 3-min transient period of exercise when work exceeds approximately 60% of VO2max. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the possible causes of this slow rise in VO2. Eighteen subjects exercised for 20 min at 65% and at 80% of VO2max on the bicycle ergometer. VO2, ventilation (VE), and respiratory exchange ratio were monitored by a continuous computer-based system. Blood lactate concentration and rectal temperatures were measured at 2- to 3-min intervals during the exercise. VO2 increased significantly from the 5th to 20th min of exercise in 81% of the tests at both levels of work intensity. The magnitude of the rise was not different for the two work loads. No evidence was found to support the lactacid explanation proposed for this rise. Increased temperature could account for 30% of the rise; the estimated cost of increased VE could account for 30 and 81% of the rise at the two work loads. The sum of these factors could account for 60 and 111% of the rise in VO2 at the 65 and 80% of VO2max work loads.},

abstract = {The pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO2) response to incremental-ramp cycle ergometry typically demonstrates lagged-linear first-order kinetics with a slope of $\sim$10-11 ml{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}W-1, both above and below the lactate threshold ($\Theta$L), i.e. there is no discernible VO2 slow component (or "excess" VO2) above $\Theta$L. We were interested in determining whether a reverse ramp profile would yield the same response dynamics. Ten healthy males performed a maximum incremental -ramp (15-30 W{\textperiodcentered}min-1, depending on fitness). On another day, the work rate (WR) was increased abruptly to the incremental maximum and then decremented at the same rate of 15-30 W.min-1 (step-decremental ramp). Five subjects also performed a sub-maximal ramp-decremental test from 90% of $\Theta$L. VO2 was determined breath-by-breath from continuous monitoring of respired volumes (turbine) and gas concentrations (mass spectrometer). The incremental-ramp VO2-WR slope was 10.3 ± 0.7 ml{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}W-1, whereas that of the descending limb of the decremental ramp was 14.2 ± 1.1 ml{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}W-1 (p < 0.005). The sub-maximal decremental-ramp slope, however, was only 9.8 ± 0.9 ml{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}W-1: not significantly different from that of the incremental-ramp. This suggests that the VO2 response in the supra-$\Theta$L domain of incremental-ramp exercise manifest not actual, but pseudo, first-order kinetics. {\textcopyright} Journal of Sports Science and Medicine.},

Seventy-seven men, with a mean age of 54, including some who were smokers, obese, or hypertensive, were judged to have normal cardiorespiratory systems based on history, physical, electrocardiogram during rest and exercise, chest X-ray, pulmonary function tests, and exercise performance. Their responses to exercise are given. It was unusual to find at maximal exercise a breathing reserve less than 11 L/min, arterial P(O2) less than 80 mm Hg, alveolar-arterial P(O2) difference greater than 38 mm Hg, arterial-end tidal P(CO2) difference greater than 1 mm Hg, respiratory frequency greater than 60, or a dead space/tidal volume ratio greater than 0.28. The normal anaerobic threshold/maximal O2 uptake ratio exceeded 40%. With maximal exercise, the intra-arterial systolic and diastolic pressures rose an average of 68 and 13 mm Hg, respectively. For predicting maximal oxygen uptake and oxygen pulse in an overweight man, we find it preferable to use age and height rather than age and weight.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine differences in cycling efficiency between competitive male and female cyclists. Thirteen trained male (mean + SD: 34 ± 8 yr, 74.1 ± 6.0 kg, Maximum Aerobic Power (MAP) 414 ± 40 W, VO2max 61.3 ± 5.4 ml kg-1 min-1) and 13 trained female (34 ± 9 yr, 60.1 ± 5.2 kg, MAP 293 ± 22 W, VO2max 48.9 ± 6.1 ml kg-1 min-1) competitive cyclists completed a cycling test to ascertain their gross efficiency (GE). Leg and lean leg volume of all cyclists was also measured. Calculated GE was significantly higher in female cyclists at 150W (22.5 ± 2.1 vs 19.9 ± 1.8%; p < 0.01) and 180W (22.3 ± 1.8 vs 20.4 ± 1.5%; p = 0.01). Cadence was not significantly different between the groups (88 ± 6 vs 91 ± 5 rev{\textperiodcentered}min-1). Lean leg volume was significantly lower for female cyclists (4.04 ± 0.5 vs 5.51 ± 0.8 dm3; p < 0.01) and was inversely related to GE in both groups at 150 and 180W (r = -0.59 and -0.58; p < 0.05). Lean leg volume was shown to account for the differences in GE between the males and females. During an "unloaded" pedalling condition, male cyclists had a significantly higher O2 cost than female cyclists (1.0 ± 0.1 vs 0.7 ± 0.1 L{\textperiodcentered}min-1; p < 0.01), indicative of a greater non-propulsive cost of cycling. These results suggest that differences in efficiency between trained male and female cyclists can be partly accounted for by sex-specific variation in lean leg volume. {\textcopyright} Journal of Sports Science and Medicine.},

abstract = {Two studies were conducted to investigate the effects of mild exercise on nitrogen balance in men given diet supplying adequate or slightly limiting energy. In experiment A the diet supplied 91 mg N/kg body weight (0.57 g protein/kg, the FAO/WHO safe level of intake) as egg white; in experiment B the same source was used to provide the 1980 NRC-RDA for adult males, 128 mg N/kg body weight (0.8 g protein/kg). By adjusting energy intake and activity, periods of energy equilibrium and negactive energy balance (-15%) were achieved at three levels of activity (X for exercise): no programmed work (0.85X), 1 hour of treadmill walking (1.0X) and 1 hour each of treadmill and cycle ergometry (1.15X). 'True' nitrogen balance (TNbal) was more positive or less negative during periods of energy equilibrium as compared to those of energy deficit. This effect of energy balance on TNbal increased with physical activity. At the lower protein intake the mean difference in TNbal between the period of energy equilibrium and that of energy deficit at 1.0X was 0.19 g N/day (nonsignificant difference) and 0.54 g N/day at 1.15X. When protein intake was increased, the difference in TNbal between periods of equilibrium and deficit was significant at all levels of activity: 0.65 g N/day at 0.85X, 0.93 g N/day at 1.0X and 1.09 g N/day at 1.15X. Physical activity was anabolic when energy balance was maintained. In experiment A the addition of 1 hour of exercise (1.0X to 1.15X) spared 2.5 mg N/kg body weight; reducing ativity by 1 hour (1.0X to 0.85X) cost 1.4 mg N/kg body weight. In experiment B, TNbal was more positive with increased activity (by 5.9 mg N/kg body weight) and more negative (by 11.5 mg N/kg body weight) when the men were sedentary. During periods of energy deficit, the anabolic effect of activity was also present, although less markedly. When activity increased from 1 to 2 hours in experiment A, TNbal improved by 2.1 mg N/kg body weight and in experiment B, by 3.5 mg N/kg body weight. Thus, circumstances of negative energy balance with adequate protein intake are better tolerated when the energy deficit is generated by physical activity than when it derives from reduced intake; the picture when protein intake is marginal requires further investigation.},

Judged both from nitrogen production, and from the extent of 13CO2 production from ingested L-[1-13C]leucine, exercise causes a substantial rise in amino acid catabolism. Amino acids catabolized during exercise appear to become available through a fall in whole-body protein synthesis and a rise in whole-body protein breakdown. After exercise, protein balance becomes positive through a rise in the rate of whole-body synthesis in excess of breakdown. Studies of free 3-methylhistidine in muscle, plasma and urine samples suggest that exercise decreases the fractional rate of myofibrillar protein breakdown, in contrast with the apparent rise in whole-body breakdown.},

Subjects were studied at both the same absolute (ABS) and relative (REL) exercise intensities posttraining. Training resulted in a significant increase in whole body V̇o(2peak) and skeletal muscle citrate synthase (CS; P < 0.001), complex I-III (P < 0.05), and total branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase (BCOAD; P < 0.001) activities. Leucine oxidation increased during exercise for the pretraining trial (PRE, P < 0.001); however, there was no increase for either the ABS or REL posttraining trial. Leucine oxidation was significantly lower for females at all time points during rest and exercise (P < 0.01). The percentage of BCOAD in the activated state was significantly increased after exercise for both the PRE and REL exercise trials, with the increase in PRE being greater (P < 0.001) compared with REL (P < 0.05). Females oxidized proportionately more lipid and less carbohydrate during exercise compared with males. In conclusion, we found that 38 days of endurance exercise training significantly attenuated both leucine oxidation and BCOAD activation during 90 min of endurance exercise at 60% V̇o(2peak) for both ABS and REL exercise intensities. Furthermore, females oxidize proportionately more lipid and less carbohydrate compared with males during endurance exercise.},

abstract = {We evaluated the hypothesis that net leg total FFA, LDL-C, and TG uptake and HDL-C release during moderate-intensity cycling exercise would be increased following endurance training. Eight sedentary men (26 ± 1 yr, 77.4 ± 3.7 kg) were studied in the postprandial state during 90 min of rest and 60 min of exercise twice before (45% and 65% V̇O2 peak) and twice after 9 wk of endurance training (55% and 65% posttraining V̇O 2 peak). Measurements across an exercising leg were taken to be a surrogate for active skeletal muscle. To determine limb lipid exchange, femoral arterial and venous blood samples drawn simultaneously at rest and during exercise were analyzed for total and individual FFA (e.g., palmitate, oleate), LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG concentrations, and limb blood flow was determined by thermodilution. The transition from rest to exercise resulted in a shift from net leg total FFA release (-44 ± 16 $\mu$mol/min) to uptake (193 ± 49 $\mu$mol/min) that was unaffected by either exercise intensity or endurance training. The relative net leg release and uptake of individual FFA closely resembled their relative abundances in the plasma with ∼21 and 41% of net leg total FFA uptake during exercise accounted for by palmitate and oleate, respectively. Endurance training resulted in significant changes in arterial concentrations of HDL-C (49 ± 5 vs. 52 ± 5 mg/dl, pre vs. post) and LDL-C (82 ± 9 vs. 76 ± 9 mg/dl, pre vs. post), but there was no net TG or LDL-C uptake or HDL-C release across the resting or active leg before or after endurance training. In conclusion, endurance training favorably affects blood lipoprotein profiles, even in young, healthy normolipidemic men, but muscle contractions per se have little effect on net leg LDL-C, or TG uptake or HDL-C release during moderate-intensity cycling exercise. Therefore, the favorable effects of physical activity on the lipid profiles of young, healthy normolipidemic men in the postprandial state are not attributable to changes in HDL-C or LDL-C exchange across active skeletal muscle.},

abstract = {Purpose of review: Carbohydrate feeding has been shown to be ergogenic, but recently substantial advances have been made in optimizing the guidelines for carbohydrate intake during prolonged exercise. Recent findings: It was found that limitations to carbohydrate oxidation were in the absorptive process most likely because of a saturation of carbohydrate transporters. By using a combination of carbohydrates that use different intestinal transporters for absorption it was shown that carbohydrate delivery and oxidation could be increased. Studies demonstrated increases in exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates of up to 65% of glucose: fructose compared with glucose only. Exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates reach values of 1.75 g/min whereas previously it was thought that 1 g/min was the absolute maximum. The increased carbohydrate oxidation with multiple transportable carbohydrates was accompanied by increased fluid delivery and improved oxidation efficiency, and thus the likelihood of gastrointestinal distress may be diminished. Studies also demonstrated reduced fatigue and improved exercise performance with multiple transportable carbohydrates compared with a single carbohydrate. Summary: Multiple transportable carbohydrates, ingested at high rates, can be beneficial during endurance sports in which the duration of exercise is 3 h or more. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract = {Twenty-eight subjects (6 normal men, 14 distance runners, and 8 rowers) were tested for maximal oxygen uptake ( {Mathematical expression}) and associated physiological measures during bicycle ergometer exercise with toe stirrups while standing (BEts) and during treadmill exercise (TM). Correlation between BEts {Mathematical expression} and TM {Mathematical expression} was high (r=0.901, p<0.05). No significant difference existed between the two {Mathematical expression} values (60.3±8.9 vs. 60.5±9.7 ml {\textperiodcentered} kg-1 {\textperiodcentered} min-1; n=28). No differences were found even when three different subgroups were separately compared. It is concluded that the higher {Mathematical expression} elicited during BEts as compared with normal sitting cycling may be attributed to the increased muscle blood flow and/ or involvement of a larger muscle mass, the latter being partly evidenced by the observation of greater electrornyographic activity during BEts. {\textcopyright} 1987 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The present study evaluated whether intracellular partial pressure of O2 (PO2) modulates the muscle O2 uptake (V̇O2) as exercise intensity increased. Indirect calorimetry followed V̇O2, whereas nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) monitored the high-energy phosphate levels, intracellular pH, and intracellular PO2 in the gastrocnemius muscle of four untrained subjects at rest, during plantar flexion exercise with a constant load at a repetition rate of 0.75, 0.92, and 1.17 Hz, and during postexercise recovery. V̇O2 increased linearly with exercise intensity and peaked at 1.17 Hz (15.1 ± 0.37 watts), when the subjects could maintain the exercise for only 3 min. V̇O2 reached a peak value of 13.0 ± 1.59 ml O2 {\textperiodcentered} min-1 {\textperiodcentered} 100 ml leg volume-1. The 31P spectra indicated that phosphocreatine decreased to 32% of its resting value, whereas intracellular pH decreased linearly with power output, reaching 6.86. Muscle ATP concentration, however, remained constant throughout the exercise protocol. The 1H NMR deoxymyoglobin signal, reflecting the cellular PO2, decreased in proportion to increments in power output and V̇O2. At the highest exercise intensity and peak V̇O2, myoglobin was $\sim$50% desaturated. These findings, taken together, suggest that the O2 gradient from hemoglobin to the mitochondria can modulate the O2 flux to meet the increased V̇O2 in exercising muscle, but declining cellular PO2 during enhanced mitochondrial respiration suggests that O2 availability is not limiting V̇O2 during exercise.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the effects of 8 weeks of resistance training (RT) on the myoglobin concentration ([Mb]) in human skeletal muscle, and to compare the change in the [Mb] in two different RT protocols. The two types of protocol used were interval RT (IRT) of moderate to low intensity with a high number of repetitions and a short recovery time, and repetition RT (RRT) of high intensity with a low number of repetitions and a long recovery time. A group of 11 healthy male adults voluntarily participated in this study and were divided into IRT (n = 6) and RRT (n = 5) groups. Both training protocols were carried out twice a week for 8 weeks. At the completion of the training period, the one-repetition maximal force values and isometric force were increased significantly in all the subjects, by about 38.8% and 26.0%, respectively (P < 0.01). The muscle fibre composition was unchanged by the 8 weeks of training. The muscle fibre cross-sectional areas were increased significantly by both types of training in all fibre types (I, IIa and IIb, mean +16.1%, P < 0.05). The [Mb] showed no significant changes at the completion of the training [IRT from 4.63 (SD 0.63) to 4.48 (SD 0.72), RRT from 4.47 (SD 0.75) to 4.24 (SD 0.80) mg{\textperiodcentered}g-1 wet tissue] despite a significant decrease in citrate synthase activity [IRT from 5.27 (SD 1.45) to 4.49 (SD 1.48), RRT from 5.33 (SD 2.09) to 4.85 (SD 1.87) $\mu$mol{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}g-1 wet tissue; P < 0.05] observed after both protocols. These results suggested that myoglobin and mitochondria enzymes were regulated by different mechanisms in response to either type of RT. Moreover, the maintained [Mb] in hypertrophied muscle should preserve oxygen transport from capillaries to mitochondria even when diffusion distance is increased.},

First published March 7, 2019; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00166.2018.—Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a powerful noninvasive tool with which to study the matching of oxygen delivery to oxygen utilization and the number of new publications utilizing this technique has increased exponentially in the last 20 yr. By measuring the state of oxygenation of the primary heme compounds in skeletal muscle (hemoglobin and myoglobin), greater understanding of the underlying control mechanisms that couple perfusive and diffusive oxygen delivery to oxidative metabolism can be gained from the laboratory to the athletic field to the intensive care unit or emergency room. However, the field of NIRS has been complicated by the diversity of instrumentation, the inherent limitations of some of these technologies, the associated diversity of terminology, and a general lack of standardization of protocols. This Cores of Reproducibility in Physiology (CORP) will describe in basic but important detail the most common methodologies of NIRS, their strengths and limitations, and discuss some of the potential confounding factors that can affect the quality and reproducibility of NIRS data. Recommendations are provided to reduce the variability and errors in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The goal of this CORP is to provide readers with a greater understanding of the methodology, limitations, and best practices so as to improve the reproducibility of NIRS research in skeletal muscle.},

abstract = {Introduction/Purpose: Cycling is a repetitive activity using coordinated muscle recruitment patterns to apply force to the pedals. With more muscles available for activation than required, some patterns produce high power, whereas some are more efficient. The purpose of this study was to identify relationships between muscle coordination and factors affecting muscle coordination to explain changes in overall mechanical efficiency ($\eta$O). Methods: Surface EMG, kinematics, and pedal forces were measured at 25%, 40%, 55%, 60%, 75%, and 90% V̇O 2max. Principal component analysis was used to establish muscle coordination, kinematic, and pedal force patterns associated with high and low $\eta$O. Results: At 55%-60% V̇O 2max, $\eta$O was maximized and was highly related to the muscle coordination patterns. At high $\eta$O, there was more medial and lateral gastrocnemii and soleus; less gluteus maximus, rectus femoris, and tibialis anterior; later medial and lateral vastii and biceps femoris; and earlier semitendinosus muscle activity resulting in an even distribution and synchronization of peak activity. Also, the ankle was more plantar flexed through the top and downstroke of the pedal cycle and more dorsiflexed during the upstroke for high $\eta$O. The $\eta$O was independent of the pedal force application. Conclusions: The results indicate that increased $\eta$O is achieved through the coordination of muscles crossing the same joint, sequential peak activation from knee to hip to ankle, and reliance on multiple muscles for large joint torques. Also, muscle activity variability across the top and bottom of the cycle indicates that left and right leg muscle coordination may play a significant role in efficient cycling. These findings imply that cycling at 55%-60% V̇O 2max will maximize the rider's exposure to high efficient muscle coordination and kinematics. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

The model predicts the lactate generated in the extravasal compartment (A), invasion (k1), and evasion (k 2) of lactate into and out of the blood compartment, the BLC maximum (BLCmax), and corresponding time (TBLCmax). BLC max and TBLCmax were lower (P < 0.05) in boys (BLC max 10.2 ± 1.3 mmol/l, TBLCmax 4.1 ± 0.4 min) than in adolescents (12.7 ± 1.0 mmol/l, 5.5 ± 0.7 min) and adults (13.7 ± 1.4 mmol/l, 5.7 ± 1.1 min).

To test whether these were the responses to impulse changes in the rate of ATP hydrolysis, we compared the total suprabasal oxygen consumption during recovery ($\Delta$[CP]o) with the amount of ATP hydrolyzed during a contraction, measured indirecdy as the decrease in creatine phosphate ($\Delta$[CP]o). If suprabasal ATP hydrolysis during recovery is negligible in comparison with that during contraction, ($\Delta$[CP]o)/$\Delta$[O2] should approximate the P:02 ratio for oxidative metabolism, which has an expected value of 6.1-6.5. We found: All values are ± SEM. Number in parentheses is number of measurements. We conclude that in this muscle at 20°C: (a) after a tetanus of 0.2-1.0 s, $\Delta$Qo2(t) can be considered the response to an impulse increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis; (b) the reversal during recovery of unidentified exothermic reactions occurring during the contraction (Woledge, R.

abstract = {The effects of using different algorithms to estimate the time constant of changes in oxygen uptake at the onset of square-wave 120 W cycloergometric exercise were evaluated in seven subjects. The volume of oxygen taken up at the alveoli (VO2Ai) was determined breath-by-breath (BB) from the volume of O2 transferred at the mouth (VO2mi) minus the corresponding volume changes in O2 stores in the alveoli: VO 2Ai = VO2mi-[VAi-1(FO2Ai-FO 2Ai-1) + FO2Ai{\textperiodcentered}$\Delta$VAi], where V Ai-1 is the alveolar volume at the end of the previous breath, FO2Ai and FO2Ai-1 are estimated from the fractions of end-tidal O2 in the current and previous breaths, respectively, and $\Delta$VAi is the change in volume during breath i. These quantities can be measured BB, with the exception of VAi-1 which must be assumed. The respiratory cycle has been defined as the time elapsing between identical fractions of expiratory gas in two successive breaths. Using this approach, since FO2Ai = FO2Ai-1, any assumption regarding VAi-1 becomes unnecessary. In the present study, VO2Ai was calculated firstly, by using this approach, and secondly by setting different VAi-1 values (from 0 to FRC+ 0.5 1, where FRC is the functional residual capacity). Values for alveolar O2 flow (V̇O 2Ai), as calculated from the quotient of VO2Ai divided by breath duration, were then fitted biexponentially. The time constant of the phase II kinetics of V̇O2Ai ($\tau$2) was linearly related to VAi-1, increasing from 36.6s (VAi-1=0) to 46.8s (VAi-1 = FRC + 0.5 1) while $\tau$2 estimated using the first approach amounted to 34.3 s. We concluded that, firstly, the first approach allowed us to calculate O2A during transitions in step exercise; and secondly, when using methods wherein VAi-1 must be assumed, $\tau$2 depended on VAi-1. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2002.},

abstract = {The effect of cardiovascular adjustments on the coupling of cellular to pulmonary gas exchange during unsteady states of exercise remains controversial. Computer simulations were performed to assess these influences on O2 delivery and pulmonary O2 uptake (pV̇O2). Algorithms were developed representing muscle and 'rest-of-body' compartments, connected in parallel by arterial and venous circulations to a pump-and-lungs compartment. Exercise-induced increases in V̇O2 and cardiac output went to the muscle compartment. Model parameters [e.g., time constants for blood flow and muscle O2 uptake (mV̇O2)] could be varied independently. Simulation results demonstrated that 1) the rise in pV̇O2 during exercise contains three phases; 2) the contribution f changes in venous O2 stores to pV̇O2 kinetics and the O2 deficit occur almost entirely in phase 1; 3) under a wide variety of manipulations, the kinetics of pV̇O2 in phase 2 were within a couple of seconds of that assigned to mV̇O2 (i.e., there is not an obligatory slowing of V̇O2 kinetics at the lungs relative to those at the muscles; 4) by use of available estimates of blood flow adjustment, O2 delivery would not limit mV̇O2 after exercise onset; and 5) blood flow could limit O2 delivery in recovery, if blood flow returned to base-line levels at rates similar to those during the on-transient phase.},

abstract = {Achievements in breath-hold diving depend, amongst others, on body oxygen stores at start of dive. A diver with very high lung volumes could increase dive's duration, and attain deeper depths for a given speed. Thus, we hypothesized that extreme breath-hold divers have very high lung volumes. On eight extreme breathhold divers (age 35 + 4 years, height 179 + 7 cm, body mass 76 + 6 kg) and 9 non-diving controls (age 37 + 6 years, height 177 + 4 cm, body mass 81 + 9 kg) residual volume, vital capacity and total lung capacity (TLC) were measured with a body plethysmograph. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were measured with a spirometer. Peak expiratory flow and flow-volume loops were measured with a pneumotachograph. In divers, but not in controls, volumes and capacities were systematically and significantly (p<0.01, paired t-test) higher than predicted from their body size. Consistently, volumes and capacities were significantly higher in divers than in controls, except for residual volume. Divers' TLC was 22% higher than predicted, and 21% higher than in controls. All divers' TLC was higher than 8 L, two had it higher than 9 L. FVC and FEV1 were significantly higher in divers than in controls. The FEV1/FVC ratio was the same in both groups. We conclude that extreme breath-hold divers may constitute a niche population with physiological characteristics different from those of normal individuals, facilitating the achievement of excellent diving performances. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Italia.},

After the dives (depth 40-70 m, duration 88-151 s), end-tidal O2 pressure decreased from $\sim$ 140 Torr to a minimum of 30.6 Torr, PET(CO2) increased from $\sim$ 25 Torr to a maximum of 47.0 Torr, and expired volume (BTPS) ranged from 1.32 to 2.86 liters. Pulmonary O2 exchange was 455-1,006 ml. CO2 output approached zero. [La(b)] increased from $\sim$ 1.2 mM to at most 6.46 mM. Estimated power output during dives was 513-929 ml O2/min, i.e., $\sim$ 20-30% of maximal O2 consumption. During BH, alveolar PO2 decreased from $\sim$ 130 to < 30 Torr in ED and from 125 to 45 Torr in C. PET(CO2) increased from $\sim$ 30 to $\sim$ 50 Torr in both ED and C. Contrary to C, pulmonary O2 exchange in ED was less than resting O2 consumption, whereas CO2 output approached zero in both groups. [La(b)] was unchanged. Arterial blood O2 saturation decreased more in ED than in C. ED are characterized by increased anaerobic metabolism likely due to the existence of a diving reflex.},

By means of this model, some unexplained 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy results from the literature (e.g., a decrease of P(T) in a closed system) could be explained simply on the basis of the physiological variability of k(i). Moreover, appropriate model simulations indicate that 1) 31P-NMR spectra obtained with short relaxation delays may be influenced to various extents by the metabolic and physicochemical status of the muscle; 2) the assessment of k(i) by standard NMR spectroscopy techniques may be extremely critical; 3) $\delta$PC/$\delta$P(i), as obtained from conventional 31P-NMR spectra, may represent a sensible index of k2 (the pseudo first-order chemical exchange rate constant of the adenosinetriphosphatase reaction); 4) $\delta$PC/$\delta$P(i) changes as detected from sequential (short relaxation delays) 31P-NMR spectra obtained in humans during metabolic transients (e.g., during transition from rest to work and vice versa) may represent an index of transient changes of k2.},

abstract = {It is well known that the V̇O2 readjustment rate of the whole body is faster when carrying out a given constant work load starting from a baseline of moderate exercise than from rest. However, it has not been established whether the above change is the result of faster kinetics of the oxidative machinery or, alternatively, the consequence of a reduced involvement of confounding factors such as anaerobic glycolysis or tissue O2 stores. The problem, earlier approached by chemical methods, was studied in man by 31P-NMRS assessment of the kinetics of phosphocreatine (PC) hydrolysis at the muscle level which is known to reflect the readjustment rate of the oxidative reactions. Twelve normal subjects carried out in a 90 cm bore modified Picker (1.5 T) magnet, a series of contractions by the plantar flexors reaching pre-set submaximal toads either in single steps (constant load, CL) or progressively (incremental exercise, I). If preceding exercise (I), compared to rest, influenced the rate of oxidations, the PC concentration at the target loads would be different for the two exercise modes, reflecting different energy deficits. This was not the case. Thus the present results show that the rate of readjustment of oxidations at the muscle level is not affected by priming exercise confirming previous findings and showing that theoretical models of V̇O2 control are experimentally applicable to man.},

abstract = {Whole-body O2 uptake (VO2), O2 deficit and the concentration of high-energy phosphates (determined by 31P spectroscopy) in human calf muscle were measured during moderate aerobic square-wave exercise of increasing intensity in ten volunteers. Net VO2 (above resting) increased linearly with mechanical power, yielding a delta efficiency of 13.1%. "Gross" O2 deficit increased linearly with net VO2. The fraction of phosphocreatine (PC) split at steady state increased linearly with the mechanical power and with the O2 deficit. If the [PC] in resting muscle is known, the slope of the regression between PC split and O2 deficit (in millimoles) yields the P/O2 ratio. To calculate this, the O2 deficit was corrected for the amount of O2 derived from the body stores, as obtained from literature data. The value so obtained, for a resting [PC] of 30 mM was 5.9, consistent with canonical textbook values. Furthermore, the ratio of "true" O2 deficit to steady-state VO2 is a measure of the time constant of VO2 kinetics at work onset at the muscle level: assuming a monoexponential time course without time delays it amounted to about 17 s, close to the value that can be expected in mammalian muscle at 37 °C.},

abstract = {Information about the control of mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle in vivo can be obtained from the relationship between the rate of mitochondrial oxidation and the intracellular concentrations of phosphorus metabolites, although the analysis is complicated by the constraints imposed by the creatine kinase equilibrium. The rate of phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery after exercise measured by 31P MRS is an estimate of net oxidative ATP synthesis. Analysing such data from normal and abnormal human muscle, we show that the approximately exponential recovery kinetics of ADP and PCr imply that the rate of PCr resynthesis has a hyperbolic dependence on [ADP] but remains approximately linear with respect to the concentration of orthophosphate (Pi) and therefore also [PCr] and [creatine]. Both kinds of relationship are consistent with experimental data from exercising animal muscle and also with data from isolated mitochondria which suggest kinetic control of mitochondrial ATP synthesis of [ADP]. These relationships are altered in proven mitochondrial disease. This analysis offers a way to quantify mitochondrial function and its abnormalities in vivo.

abstract = {In skeletal muscle, phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery from submaximal exercise has become a reliable and accepted measure of muscle oxidative capacity. During exercise, O2 availability plays a role in determining maximal oxidative metabolism, but the relationship between O2 availability and oxidative metabolism measured by 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) during recovery from exercise has never been studied. We used 31P- MRS to study exercising human gastrocnemius muscle under conditions of varied fractions of inspired O2 (FI(O2)) to test the hypothesis that varied O2 availability modulates PCr recovery from submaximal exercise. Six male subjects performed three bouts of 5-min steady-state submaximal plantar flexion exercise followed by 5 min of recovery in a 1.5-T magnet while breathing three different FI(O2) concentrations (0.10, 0.21, and 1.00). Under each FI(O2) treatment, the PCr recovery time constants were significantly different, being longer in hypoxia [33.5 ± 4.1 s (SE)] and shorter in hyperoxia (20.0 ± 1.8 s) than in normoxia (25.0 ± 2.7 s) (P ≤ 0.05). End-exercise pH was not significantly different among the three treatments (7.08 ± 0.01 for 0.10, 7.04 ± 0.01 for 0.21, and 7.04 ± 0.02 for 1.00). These results demonstrate that PCr recovery is significantly altered by FI(O2) and suggest that, after submaximal exercise, PCr recovery, under normoxic conditions, is limited by O2 availability.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to ascertain the optimal test duration to elicit the highest maximal lactate formation rate (V˙Lamax), whilst exploring the underpinning energetics, and identifying the optimal blood lactate sampling period. Methods: Fifteen trained to well-trained males (age 27 ± 6 years; peak power: 1134 ± 174 W) participated in a randomised cross-over design completing three all-out sprint cycling tests of differing test durations (10, 15, and 30 s). Peak and mean power output (W and W.kg−1), oxygen uptake, and blood lactate concentrations were measured. V˙Lamax and energetic contributions (phosphagen, glycolytic, and oxidative) were determined using these parameters. Results: The shortest test duration of 10 s elicited a significantly (p = 0.003; p < 0.001) higher V˙Lamax (0.86 ± 0.17 mmol.L−1.s−1; 95% CI 0.802–0.974) compared with both 15 s (0.68 ± 0.18 mmol.L−1.s−1; 95% CI 0.596–0.794) and 30 s (0.45 ± 0.07 mmol.L−1.s−1; 95% CI 0.410–0.487). Differences in V˙Lamax were associated with large effect sizes (d = 1.07, d = 3.15). We observed 81% of the PCr and 53% of the glycolytic work completed over the 30 s sprint duration was attained after 10 s. BLamaxpost were achieved at 5 ± 2 min (ttest 10 s), 6 ± 2 min (ttest 15 s), and 7 ± 2 min (ttest 30 s), respectively. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated a 10 s test duration elicited the highest V˙Lamax. Furthermore, the 10 s test duration mitigated the influence of the oxidative metabolism during all-out cycling. The optimal sample time to determine peak blood lactate concentration following 10 s was 5 ± 2 min.},

Thirteen trained males completed five 10-second maximal isokinetic cycling sprints on a bicycle ergometer at different pedaling frequencies (90 rpm, 110 rpm, 130 rpm, 150 rpm, 170 rpm) with continuous power and frequency measurement. Capillary blood samples were taken pre-exercise and up to 30 minutes post-exercise to determine the maximum blood lactate concentration.Blood lactate accumulation was calculated as the difference between maximal post-exercise and pre-start blood lactate concentration. Repeated measurement ANOVA with Bonferroni-adjusted post hoc t-tests revealed significant progressive increases in maximal blood lactate concentration and accumulation with higher pedaling frequencies (p<0.001; $\eta$(2)+>+0.782).The findings demonstrate a significant influence of pedaling frequency on lactate accumulation, emphasizing its relevance in anaerobic diagnostics. Optimal assessment of maximal lactate formation rate is suggested to require a pedaling frequency of at least 130 rpm or higher, while determining metabolic thresholds using the maximal lactate formation rate may benefit from a slightly lower pedaling frequency.},

Nine male elite track cyclists performed four maximal sprints (3, 8, 12, 60 s) on a cycle ergometer. Crank force and cadence were monitored continuously to determine PRmax and tFf based on force-velocity profiles. SmO2 of the vastus lateralis muscle and respiratory gases were measured until the 30th minute after exercise. WPCr was calculated based on the fast component of the post-exercise oxygen uptake for each sprint. Before and for 30 minutes after each sprint, capillary blood samples were taken to determine the associated $\Delta$BLC. Temporal changes of SmO2, WPCr and $\Delta$BLC were analysed via non-linear regression analysis. v̇ Lamax was calculated based on $\Delta$BLC(t) as the highest blood lactate accumulation rate. All models showed excellent quality (R2 > 0.95). The time constant of SmO2(t) $\tau$SmO2 = 2.93 ± 0.65 s was correlated with the time constant of WPCr(t) $\tau$PCr = 3.23 ± 0.67 s (r = 0.790, p < 0.012), v̇ Lamax = 0.95 ± 0.18 mmol {\textperiodcentered} l−1 {\textperiodcentered} s−1 (r = 0.768, p < 0.017) and PRmax = 299.51 ± 14.70 rpm (r = -0.670, p < 0.049). tFf was correlated with $\tau$SmO2 (r = 0.885, p < 0.001). Our results show a time-dependent reflection of SmO2 kinetics and phosphagen energy contribution during a 60-s maximal cycling sprint. A high v̇ Lamax results in a reduction, a high PRmax in an increase of the desaturation rate. The half-life of SmO2 desaturation indicates the end of the fatigue-free state.},

abstract = {Background: This study aimed to investigate the changes in force-velocity (F/v) and power-velocity (P/v) relationships with increasing work rate up to maximal oxygen uptake and to assess the resulting alterations in optimal cadence, particularly at characteristic metabolic states. Methods: Fourteen professional track cyclists (9 sprinters, 5 endurance athletes) performed submaximal incremental tests, high-intensity cycling trials, and maximal sprints at varied cadences (60, 90, 120 rpm) on an SRM bicycle ergometer. Linear and non-linear regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between heart rate, oxygen uptake (V.O2), blood lactate concentration and power output at each pedaling rate. Work rates linked to various cardiopulmonary and metabolic states, including lactate threshold (LT1), maximal fat combustion (FATmax), maximal lactate steady-state (MLSS) and maximal oxygen uptake (V.O2max), were determined using cadence-specific inverse functions. These data were used to calculate state-specific force-velocity (F/v) and power-velocity (P/v) profiles, from which state-specific optimal cadences were derived. Additionally, fatigue-free profiles were generated from sprint data to illustrate the entire F/v and P/v continuum. Results: HR, V.O2 demonstrated linear relationships, while BLC exhibited an exponential relationship with work rate, influenced by cadence (p < 0.05, $\eta$2 ≥ 0.655). Optimal cadence increased sigmoidally across all parameters, ranging from 66.18 ± 3.00 rpm at LT1, 76.01 ± 3.36 rpm at FATmax, 82.24 ± 2.59 rpm at MLSS, culminating at 84.49 ± 2.66 rpm at V.O2max (p < 0.01, $\eta$2 = 0.936). A fatigue-free optimal cadence of 135 ± 11 rpm was identified. Sprinters and endurance athletes showed no differences in optimal cadences, except for the fatigue-free optimum (p < 0.001, d = 2.215). Conclusion: Optimal cadence increases sigmoidally with exercise intensity up to maximal aerobic power, irrespective of the athlete's physical condition or discipline. Threshold-specific changes in optimal cadence suggest a shift in muscle fiber type recruitment toward faster types beyond these thresholds. Moreover, the results indicate the need to integrate movement velocity into Henneman's hierarchical size principle and the critical power curve. Consequently, intensity zones should be presented as a function of movement velocity rather than in absolute terms.},

abstract = {Needle biopsies were performed in the m. quadriceps femoris of normal subjects, at rest and in connection with work on a bicycle ergometer. The concentrations of PC and ATP were determined in the biopsy material. The normal values in resting muscle were as follows: ATP 2.43 mmole per 100 g dry muscle (S.D. 0.21), PC 6.78 mmole per 100 g dry muscle (S.D. 0.70). The PC concentration was found to decrease rapidly during the first 2 minutes of continuous work, then remaining at a relatively constant level. The resynthesis of PC after work is complete within a few minutes. It has been demonstrated that a reverse relationship exists between the work load and the PC concentration in the muscle during work. At very high work loads the PC concentration decreases rapidly down to zero and the contractive capacity of the muscles ceases. When the glycogen store is considerably decreased, the PC level at work is lower than when work with the same load is carried out with the glycogen store intact. The ATP concentration also decreases during the first minutes of work, but during continuous work with low or moderately high loads the concentration of ATP tends to return to the basal level. At heavy work with pronounced decreases of PC, the ATP concentration also stays decreased. When the PC level is near zero the ATP decrease is approximately 40 per cent of the basal value. {\textcopyright} 1967 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

abstract = {Heavy dynamic exercise using both arm and leg muscles was performed to exhaustion by seven well-trained subjects. The aerobic and anaerobic energy utilization was determined and/or calculated. O2 uptake during exercise and during 1 h of recovery was measured as well as splanchnic and muscle metabolite exchange. Glycogen and lactate content in the quadriceps femoris was determined before exercise, immediately after exercise, and after a recovery period. In four male subjects the estimated mean lactate production during exercise was 830 mmol. The splanchnic uptake of lactate during recovery was 80 mmol, and the calculated maximum amount oxidized during the recovery period was 330 mmol. About 60 mmol were accounted for in the body water at the end of the rest period. The remaining 360 mmol lactate were apparently resynthesized into glycogen in muscle via gluconeogenesis. It is concluded that $\sim$50% of the lactate formed during heavy exercise is transformed to glycogen via glyconeogenesis in muscle during recovery and that lactate uptake by the liver is only 10%.},

Oxygen uptake was determined throughout exercise and recovery. Muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis) and fingertip blood samples were taken at rest and during recovery. Muscle ATP and creatine phosphate concentrations became reduced during exercise at all intensities. Little or no increase in lactate was observed below apprpx. 60% altitude max Vo2. The hypoxic condition caused a decreased acceleration from resting Vo2 and an increase in O2‐deficit at each absolute intensity as compared with normoxia. Close relationships were observed between level of high‐energy phosphate depletion and both O2‐deficit and fast component of O2‐debt not different from the same relationships under normoxic conditions. Virtually all differences in physiological response to identical exercise intensities at altitude as compared to normoxia were appropriately adjusted by expressing exercise intensity relative to the respective aerobic power capacities in the two conditions. Physiological responses to this type of exercise appear determined in great part by the availability of oxygen. {\textcopyright} 1973 Scandinavian Physiological Society},

abstract = {We assessed the linearity of oxygen uptake (V$\sim$2) kinetics for several work intensities in four trained cyclists. V$\sim$2 was measured breath by breath during transitions from 33 W (baseline) to work rates requiring 38, 54, 85, and 100% of maximal aerobic capacity (V$\sim$(2max)). Each subject repeated each work rate four times over 8 test days. In every case, three phases (phases 1, 2, and 3) of the V$\sim$2 response could be identified. V$\sim$2 during phase 2 was fit by one of two models: model 1, a double exponential where both terms begin together close to the start of phase 2, and model 2, a double exponential where each of the exponential terms begins independently with separate time delays. V$\sim$2 rose linearly for the two lower work rates (slope 11 ml {\textperiodcentered} min-1 W-1) but increased to a greater asymptote for the two heavier work rates. In all four subjects, for the two lighter work rates the double-exponential regression reduced to a single value for the time constant (average across subjects 16.1 ± 7.7 s), indicating a truly monoexponential response. In addition, one of the responses to the heaviest work rate was monoexponential. For the remaining seven biexponential responses to the two heaviest work rates, model 2 produced a significantly better fit to the responses (P < 0.05), with a mean time delay for the slow component of 105 ± 46 s. The amplitude of the primary component (A1) increased linearly across all four work rates (slope 9.1 ml {\textperiodcentered} min-1 {\textperiodcentered} W-1, r = 0.957). In contrast, the time constant for the fast component ($\tau$1) exhibited no significant change as work rate increased. Thus, although the overall oxygen cost increases nonlinearly with work intensity, the primary component of the V$\sim$2 response exhibits approximately linear behavior: linear increase in gain (A1) and invariant time constant ($\tau$1).},

These impair the precision of characterizing non-steady-state gas exchange kinetics during exercise. We quantified the effects of this noise on the confidence of estimating kinetic parameters of the underlying physiological responses and hence of model discrimination. Five subjects each performed eight transitions from 0 to 100 W on a cycle ergometer. Ventilation, CO2 output, and O2 uptake were computed breath by breath. The eight responses were interpolated uniformly, time aligned, and averaged for each subject; and the kinetic parameters of a first-order model (i.e., the time constant and time delay) were then estimated using three methods: a) linear least squares, b) nonlinear least squares, and c) maximum likelihood. The breath-by-breath noise approximated an uncorrelated Gaussian stochastic process, with a standard deviation that was largely independent of metabolic rate. An expression has therefore been derived for the number of square-wave repetitions required for a specified parameter confidence using methods b and c; method a being less appropriate for parameter estimation of noisy gas exchange kinetics.},

One and two component exponential curves fit the observed oxygen uptake and recovery measures with a high degree of accuracy. Comparison of the curve parameters with published data showed large differences for the post exercise oxygen recovery and the slow component of the recovery curve. The magnitude of the fast component of recovery was similar to other data. The total oxygen uptake during the test was found to be 10% lower than the maximal oxygen uptake determined on a seperate progressive step-increment test.

Six, healthy, male volunteers (aged 22 to 58 years), each performed 13 exercise tests: initial ramp-incremental cycle ergometry to the limit of tolerance and subsequently, on different days, three bouts of square-wave exercise each at moderate, heavy, very heavy and severe intensities. Pulmonary gas exchange variables were determined breath by breath throughout exercise and recovery from the continuous monitoring of respired volumes (turbine) and gas concentrations (mass spectrometer). 3. For moderate exercise, the V(O(2)) kinetics were well described by a simple mono-exponential function, following a short cardiodynamic phase, with the on- and off-transients having similar time constants (tau(1)); i.e. tau(1,on) averaged 33 +/- 16 s (+/- S.D.) and tau(1,off) 29 +/- 6 s. 4. The on-transient V(O(2)) kinetics were more complex for heavy exercise. The inclusion of a second slow and delayed exponential component provided an adequate description of the response; i.e. tau(1,on) = 32 +/- 17 s and tau(2,on) = 170 +/- 49 s. The off-transient V(O(2)) kinetics, however, remained mono-exponential (tau(1,off) = 42 +/- 11 s). 5. For very heavy exercise, the on-transient V(O(2)) kinetics were also well described by a double exponential function (tau(1,on) = 34 +/- 11 s and tau(2,on) = 163 +/- 46 s). However, a double exponential, with no delay, was required to characterise the off-transient kinetics (i.e. tau(1,off) = 33 +/- 5 s and tau(2,off) = 460 +/- 123 s). 6. At the highest intensity (severe), the on-transient V(O(2)) kinetics reverted to a mono-exponential profile (tau(1,on) = 34 +/- 7 s), while the off-transient kinetics retained a two-component form (tau(1,off) = 35 +/- 11 s and tau(2,off) = 539 +/- 379 s). 7. We therefore conclude that the kinetics of V(O(2)) during dynamic muscular exercise are strikingly influenced by the exercise intensity, both with respect to model order and to dynamic asymmetries between the on- and off-transient responses.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to quantify the changes in selected intramuscular metabolites associated with non-oxidative energy metabolism after performance of the Wingate Test (WT), a widely used, exhaustive, 30-s cycle test of short-time muscular power. Muscle biopsies were taken from the m. vastus lateralis of nine female physical education students at rest and immediately after performance of the WT. The concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine phosphate (CP), lactate, and glycogen were determined. The ATP decreased from 20.9 to 13.8; CP decreased from 62.7 to 25.1; lactate increased from 9.0 to 60.5; and glycogen decreased from 360 to 278 (all concentrations are mmol X kg-1 dry muscle). The absolute changes in CP and lactate were not as large as those reported in other exercise studies. Based on the metabolite changes, it was concluded that the WT is a satisfactory test of the maximal muscular power that can be generated from non-oxidative metabolism, but that the 30-s duration of the test probably does not tax the maximal capacity of such energy metabolism.},

abstract = {Lactate production in skeletal muscle has now been studied for nearly two centuries and still its production and functional role at rest and during exercise is much debated. In the early days skeletal muscle was mainly seen as the site of lactate production during contraction and lactate production associated with a lack of muscle oxygenation and fatigue. Later it was recognized that skeletal muscle not only played an important role in lactate production but also in lactate clearance and this led to a renewed interest, not the least from the Copenhagen School in the 1930s, in the metabolic role of lactate in skeletal muscle. With the introduction of lactate isotopes muscle lactate kinetics and oxidation could be studied and a simultaneous lactate uptake and release was observed, not only in muscle but also in other tissues. Therefore, this review will discuss in vivo human: (1) skeletal muscle lactate metabolism at rest and during exercise and suggestions are put forward to explain the simultaneous lactate uptake and release; and (2) lactate metabolism in the heart, liver, kidneys, brain, adipose tissue and lungs will be discussed and its potential importance in these tissues. {\textcopyright} 2010 Scandinavian Physiological Society.},

abstract = {The kinetics of phosphocreatine (PC) breakdown in human plantar flexors at the onset of constant-load aerobic exercise was determined by high-resolution 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMRS). The half time of the process (t( 1/2 )ṖC) was obtained by fitting curves (n = 13) from five subjects at various aerobic work loads for which muscle pH was not different from that at rest. Steady-state PC concentration ([PC]) was not <70% of the resting value and was linearly related to the work load (w) {[PC] = -3.01 ± 0.08 w + 1 (r = 0.48, 2P < 0.1)}. The average t( 1/2 )ṖC was 16.2 s and was independent of work load. Because the half time of the muscle PC kinetics reflects the half time of the O2 uptake (ṀO2) kinetics (t( 1/2 )ṀO2), the latter is equal to that found earlier in the isolated perfused dog gastrocnemius. Whereas in the dog the above t( 1/2 )ṀO2 compares well with the homologous half time of the O2 uptake at the alveolar level, in humans such equivalence is found only at extremely low work loads, when the transient contribution by anaerobic glycolysis is negligible.},

Eight young (24 ± 3 yr) and eight older (70 ± 4 yr) women performed 6-min periods of cycling at 75% ventilatory threshold at pedal frequencies of 45, 60, 75, and 90 rpm under control and passively elevated local muscle temperature conditions. Mechanical efficiency was calculated from the ratio of energy turnover (pulmonary O2 uptake) and mechanical power output. Overall, elevating muscle temperature increased (P < 0.05) mechanical efficiency in young (32.0 ± 3.1 to 34.0 ± 5.5%) and decreased (P < 0.05) efficiency in older women (30.2 ± 5.6 to 27.9 ± 4.1%). The different effect of elevated muscle temperature in young and older women reflects a shift in the efficiency-velocity relationship of skeletal muscle. These effects may be due to differences in recruitment patterns, as well as sarcopenic and fiber-type changes with age. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 the American Physiological Society.},

For the interpretation of BLa as a parameter of metabolic activity, there is no fundamental concept. This contributes to multiple and debatable presentations of BLa thresholds and leads to controversial conclusions and divergent applications of BLa tests. The purpose of this study was to present some results of a swim-specific calculation scheme (SCS) which depicts BLa in the context of the whole metabolic process. The SCS is based on a mathematical approach to aerobic and anaerobic metabolism regulation and describes BLa as a result of oxidative BLa elimination and BLa production (BLaP) rates related to the maximal capacity of BLaP and oxygen uptake (VO ). The scheme also needs a speed-energy expenditure relation (SE$\sim$). The study was performed on 778 male swimmers using two-speed tests, competition or training series at constant speed (TRS).},

abstract = {Following the onset of exercise there is a sudden increase in metabolic heat production that cannot be initially offset by the body's heat loss mechanisms. During this thermal imbalance a change in body heat content (DHb) occurs. The only way the value for DHb can be truly determined is by performing simultaneous direct measurements of the rates of heat production and heat loss. There are several calorimetric methods that can be used to quantify these values. The most accurate and simple method for measuring the rate of heat production is by separately calculating the energy released from the oxidation of fats and carbohydrates using indirect calorimetry, while direct air flow calorimetry provides the most accurate and responsive measurement of total body heat loss. Thermometry is often used as a surrogate for calorimetry by estimating mean body temperature and subsequently deriving a value for DHb. The most common thermometry approach, the 2-compartment model of “core” and “shell” temperature, has been demonstrated to greatly underestimate DHb. The inclusion of a third compartment representing the thermal influences of muscle tissue has been demonstrated to provide a better thermometric estimation of DHb; however this requires the invasive measurement of intramuscular temperature. A modified 2-compartment thermometry model incorporating an “adjustment factor” correcting for the underestimation of the traditional model for DHb appears to be the most practical alternative. Further research is required to develop thermometry model for the better estimation of DHb under various conditions.},

abstract = {The excess post-exercise energy expenditure has often been regarded as a significant contribution to weight loss. However, the immediate post-exercise oxygen consumption is also elevated through the resynthesis of creatinephosphate (CrP), which energetically should be attributed to the phase of exercise. Therefore, the energy metabolism after CrP-resynthesis is more likely to reflect the importance of post-exercise energy expenditure. In the present study, 31 subjects (17 females, 14 males; BMI 29.7 ± 7.4 kg/m2) participated in the tests. Energy expenditure was measured by means of spirometry over 20 min intervals before and from the 15th to the 35th min after their usual fitness training. 15 subjects performed exclusively endurance exercises and 16 subjects combined endurance with strength training. The intensities corresponded to 50 % to 80% of the individual performance capacity. The main results were as follows: Energy expenditure correlated significantly with body weight (p < 0.01). Energy expenditure before and after training was nearly identical and amounted to 6.14 ± 1.56 kJ/min and 6.30 ± 1.48 kJ/min, respectively (not significant) and did not depend on the kind of training. After exercise, lipometabolism contributed 63 ± 12% of the overall energy expenditure compared to 42 ± 13% before training (p < 0.05). In conclusion, post-exercise energy expenditure after usual fitness training does not contribute significantly to weight loss.},

abstract = {Sprint swimming is a short duration, high intensity sport requiring a relatively greater contribution of energy from anaerobic metabolism. Understanding energy system utilization for the classification of a competitive swimmer (sprint or distance) may be useful for both training prescription and event specialization. The relationship between anaerobic swim ergometer testing and adolescent sprint swimming performance has not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance and physiological responses during a maximal all-out ergometer test as well as the maximal anaerobic lactate test in a group of sprint vs. middle-distance specialized swimmers. Sixteen (n = 16) competitive swimmers (mean + standard deviation (SD), age 16.8 + 0.7 year, body mass 67.3 + 9.8 kg) were categorized into two gender matched groups: Sprint (n = 8) and middle-distance (n = 8). Each athlete performed (1) a 45 s swim ergometer maximal test to determine peak and mean power output (Watts (W)), (2) a MANLT test to determine peak and average velocity as well as the post-exercise lactate response, and (3) a 50 m swim time trial. The sprint group showed a higher mean (p = 0.026) and peak (p = 0.031) velocity during the MANLT. In addition, blood lactate concentration was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the sprint vs. middledistance trained group at 3 and 12 min after completion of the MANLT (3-min post 11.29 + 2.32 vs. 9.55 + 3.48 mmol/L, 12-min post 8.23 + 2.28 vs. 7.05 + 2.47 mmol/L). The power output during the 45 s all-out swimming ergometer test was higher in the sprint trained group. The results of this study demonstrate the anaerobic contribution to sprint swimming measured during an all-out dryland ergometer test.},

abstract = {Purpose: To assess the test-retest reliability of the continuous (PCr-LA-O2) and intermittent (PCr-LA-O2int) version of the 3-component model of energy distribution in an applied setting. Methods: Sixteen male handball players (age 23 [3] y, height 185 [7] cm, weight 85 [14] kg) completed the 30-15 Intermittent Fitness Test (30-15IFT) twice. Performance was assessed by peak speed (speed of the last successfully completed stage of the 30-15IFT [VIFT], in kilometers per hour) and time to exhaustion (in seconds). Oxygen uptake (in milliliters per kilogram per minute) and blood lactate concentrations (in millimoles per liter) were obtained before, during, and until 15 minutes after exercise. Total metabolic energy (in joules per kilogram), total metabolic power (in watts per kilogram), and energy shares (in joules per kilogram and percentage) of the aerobic (energy contribution of the aerobic system [WAERint]), anaerobic lactic, and anaerobic alactic (anaerobic alactic energy [WPCrint]) systems were calculated using both model versions, respectively. Results: Test-retest reliability was very good for VIFT (limits of agreement [LoA]: -1.13 to 0.63 km{\textperiodcentered}h-1, coefficient of variation [CV%] 1.68), time to exhaustion (LoA: -101 to 38 s, CV% 2.92), peak oxygen uptake (LoA: -2.68 to 4.04 mL{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}kg-1, CV% 1.48), and peak heart rate (-6.9 to 7.7 beats{\textperiodcentered}min-1, CV% 1.1), but moderate for change in blood lactate concentration (LoA: -3.84 to 4.07 mmol{\textperiodcentered}L-1, CV% 11.43). Reliability of the modeled total energy and its fractions were high for total metabolic energy (LoA: -1489 to 1177 J{\textperiodcentered}kg-1, CV% 2.88), total metabolic power (LoA: -2.0 to 1.9 W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1, CV% 3.58), contribution of aerobic (LoA: -1673 to 1283 J{\textperiodcentered}kg-1, CV% 3.62), WAERint (LoA: -1760 to 2160 J{\textperiodcentered}kg-1, CV% 6.04), and moderate for anaerobic alactic (LoA: -368 to 439 J{\textperiodcentered}kg-1, CV% 14.85), WPCrint (LoA: -1707 to 988 J{\textperiodcentered}kg-1, CV% 9.98), and energy share of anaerobic lactic concentration (LoA: -229 to 235 J{\textperiodcentered}kg-1, CV% 11.43). Conclusion: Considering the inherent fluctuations of the underlying energetics, the reliabilities of both versions of the 3-component model of energy distribution are acceptable for applied settings.},

abstract = {Context: Different relative aerobic energy contribution (WAER%) has been reported for the 2 women's Olympic kayaking disciplines (ie, 200 and 500 m). Purpose: To investigate whether the adopted method of energy calculation influences the value of WAER% during kayaking time trials. Methods: Eleven adolescent female kayakers (age 14 ± 1 y, height 172 ± 4 cm, body mass 65.4 ± 4.2 kg, VO2peak 42.6 ± 4.9 mL{\textperiodcentered}min?1{\textperiodcentered}kg?1, training experience 1.5 ± 0.3 y) volunteered to participate in 1 incremental exercise test and 2 time trials (40 and 120 s) on the kayak ergometer. A portable spirometric system was used to measure gas metabolism. Capillary blood was taken from the ear lobe during and after the tests and analyzed for lactate afterward. The method of modified maximal accumulated oxygen deficit (m-MAOD) and the method based on the fast component of oxygen-uptake off-kinetics (PCr-La-O2) were used to calculate the energy contributions. Results: The anaerobic energy portions from m-MAOD were lower than those from PCr-La-O2 in the 40-s (41.9 ± 8.8 vs 52.8 ± 4.0 kJ, P > .05) and 120-s (64.1 ± 27.9 vs 68.2 ± 10.0 kJ, P > .05) time trials, which induced differences of WAER% between m-MAOD and PCr-La-O2 (36.0% vs 30.0% in 40 s, P > .05; 60.9% vs 57.5% in 120 s, P > .05). Conclusions: The reported different WAER% in women's Olympic kayaking could be partly attributed to the adopted method of energy calculation (ie, m-MAOD vs PCr-La-O2). A fixed method of energy calculation is recommended during the longitudinal assessment on the relative energy contribution in women's Olympic kayaking.},

abstract = {Reliability of two different spiroergometric systems was investigated by comparing gas exchange measurements from two consecutive identical bicycle ergometer ramp exercise tests which were conducted after an initial habituation trial. Twenty-three healthy subjects (age: 25 ± 5 years; weight: 71 ± 10kg; peak oxygen uptake = 55 ± 9 ml × min-1 × kg-1) took part in the study. One apparatus was a portable mixing chamber system (MetaMax I, Cortex, Leipzig, Germany), the other one a stationary spiroergometric device measuring in the breath-by-breath mode (MetaLyzer 3B, Cortex). There were no relevant systematic changes in gas exchange measurements and heart rate from test 1 to test 2. Intra-class reliability coefficients were 0.984 (oxygen uptake: V̇O2), 0.977 (carbon dioxide output = V̇O2), and 0.973 (minute ventilation = V̇E) for the MetaMax I, and 0.969 (V̇O2), 0.964 (V̇CO2), and 0.953 (V̇E) for the MetaLyzer 3B. Bland-Altman plots revealed a slightly smaller variability of MetaLyzer 3B measurements compared to those of MetaMax I. It is concluded that the spiroergometric devices MetaMax I and MetaLyzer 3B represent reliable instruments for exercise testing in sports medical routine and research. This is important to decide if longitudinal changes in gas exchange measurements represent clinically meaningful differences in performance or merely inconsistencies of the measuring tool.},

abstract = {Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) allows for a non-invasive assessment of the integrative response of the pulmonary, cardiovascular, and skeletal muscle system during exercise. Therefore CPET in sports medicine covers a wide spectrum, ranging from diagnosis of disease, preoperative assessment, to athlete monitoring. High standards of reliability and validity are needed to ensure high-quality and diagnostically conclusive CPET data, necessitating a systematic process of quality assurance and control in the daily application of CPET. Therefore, methodological aspects such as CPET equipment principles, calibration, verification, maintenance, preparation, and plausibility checks need to be considered. As inter-technology, inter-device, and inter-unit differences in reliability and validity are reported for automated metabolic analyzers, the choice of the appropriate device should follow the purpose of use and comprehensible data on reliability and validity. › To ensure high-quality measurements, careful calibration, and verification of all sensors, the integrated overall measurement performance, and maintenance of all equipment need to be performed and monitored longitudinally. Further, standardized ambient conditions, with adequate circulation and exchange of room air are essential. As the choice of the ergometer and protocol influences various target values in CPET, appropriateness for the selected diagnostic objective as well as a corresponding standardization is needed. While patients should receive pretest information that clearly outlines the test procedure, the correct attachment of the CPET equipment is of utmost importance. › To detect and correct malfunctions of the metabolic analyzer and equipment, plausibility checks of the outcome measures validity should be performed during the resting, unloaded, loaded, and recovery test phase. A basic plausibility check should include adequate rest values and increases for a given workload rate of minute ventilation (˙VE), oxygen consumption (˙VO2) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER), using rules of thumb by R{\"{u}}hle. Before the final data interpretation is performed, e.g. ventilatory threshold or maximum oxygen consumption (˙VO2 max) or ˙VO2 peak determination, again a plausibility check should be performed and the patient‘s effort whether or not maximal should be determined. › Consequently, a standard operating procedure for quality assurance and control, including an intuitive data visualization with thresholds for “pass”, “fail” or outliers and trends of concerns should be specifically defined, taught, and implemented in each facility.},

First, this study developed a (theoretical) error analysis based on general error propagation theory. Second, calibration measurements using a metabolic simulator were performed. Error analysis shows that the error in oxygen uptake (Vo2) and carbon dioxide production (Vco2) is smaller for mixing chamber than for breath-by-breath systems. In general, the error of the flow sensor $\delta$V, the error in temperature of expired air $\delta$TB and the delay time error $\delta$tdelay are significant sources of error.

abstract = {Information concerning the validity and reliability of commercial on-line gas analysis systems is limited. The aim of this study was to provide a comparison of the validity and reliability of three on-line systems (Oxycon Alpha, Oxycon Pro and Pulmolab EX670) with that of Douglas bags. Two separate studies were conducted. In study 1, the three gas analysis systems were compared with Douglas bags using a metabolic simulator over four increases in ventilation. In study 2, ten subjects were split into equal groups exercising at 100 W or 150 W for 85 min on three separate occasions. Each system was used twice per visit. Study 1 demonstrated that the Oxycon Alpha and Douglas bags produced similar respiratory values over all levels of ventilation. The Oxycon Pro tended to slightly overestimate mean expiratory flow (V̇E), oxygen uptake (V̇O2), carbon dioxide production (V̇CO 2) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) at the higher ventilations. The Pulmolab produced large overestimations at all ventilations for V̇CO2 and RER (up to 26.3% away from expectations), whilst values for V̇E, and V̇O2 were slightly underestimated at higher ventilations (up to 7.5% from expectations). The results of study 2 support the findings of study 1, with the Oxycon Pro and Oxycon Alpha producing similar results compared to Douglas bags for V̇O2, V̇CO 2 and RER. The coefficients of variation for V̇O2 and V̇CO2 measured using Douglas bags, Oxycon Pro and Oxycon Alpha were 3.3-5.1%, 4.7-7.0% and 4.5-6.3%, respectively, whilst that for the Pulmolab was highly variable (26.8-45.8%). The exercise study showed the Oxycon Pro and Oxycon Alpha to be both valid and reliable on-line systems for the measurement of parameters of respiration, at least at workloads up to 150 W. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2002.},

Oxygen debt contraction and payment follow an exponential path with a half reaction time of about 20 sec. The concentration of ATP and ADP at steady state seem to be unaffected by the intensity of the exercise when this is submaximal and no appreciable production of lactic acid takes place. The concentration of creatinephosphate in muscle at steady state decreases with the intensity of the exercise. The ratio of the oxygen consumption at steady state to the alactic oxygen debt is identified with the speed constant of the resynthesis of phosphagen in muscle; the half reaction time of this process is 17-20 sec. The total alactic oxygen debt amounts to about 50 ml/kg of muscle. These figures are in good agreement with earlier data found in man. {\textcopyright} 1968 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Walking at a constant speed on a steep incline, the ratio of the mechanical work performed, as calculated by the body lift, to the energy expended, as calculated by the oxygen consumption, generally referred to as "efficiency", is independent of the incline, and it amounts to 0.25 walking uphill and to - 1.2 walking downhill. These values can be regarded as the "efficiency" values for positive (uphill) and negative (downhill) work. Walking on the level or on a mild incline, both positive and negative work are performed within the step cycle. When an equal amount of positive and negative work is performed (level walking or running) the energy level of the body at the end of the performance does not change, and the "efficiency" as calculated amounts to 0.207. This work may be considered wasted: it reaches a maximal amount on the level of 0.044 kgm/m kg walking, and of 0.088 kgm/m kg running. For this reason a constant pull in the direction of the movement cannot replace completely the pull given by the muscles, as when other systems of progression such as cycling, skiing, skating etc. are adopted. By far the greatest amount of energy spent in walking or running at a constant speed is spent in positive work performance to counteract the deceleration (negative work) taking place at the end of each step. Very little energy is supplied for internal work, i.e. to meet the resistance to progression due to friction within the body or at the contact of the foot with the soil. {\textcopyright} 1968 Springer-Verlag.},

An additional 40-50 cal/kg are provided by lactic acid formation from glycogen, and only about 10 cal/kg from oxidative processes. The energy necessary for speed maintainance may be not much more than 100-120 cal/kg, which is spent in performing an equal amount of positive and negative work. The energy necessary to accelerate the body amounts to about 60 cal/kg, while that to meet the wind resistance to about 40 cal.

These are essentially a) splitting of the high energy phosphate compounds (phosphagen), b) glycolysis and lactic acid formation, and c) oxidative reactions; b) and c) are used to rebuild the phosphagen broken down as from a). The rate of reaction a) is sensibly constant during the first 6-8 secs of work at maximum rate, then declining with the exhaustion of phosphagen. By measuring the maximal rate of work in an exercise such as running up a staircase for 1-2 secs only (4-8 steps), the maximal anaerobic power can be measured: this is done by measuring the time of performance with a timer sensitive to 0.01 secs, and by knowing the height of the step. The test is fast and easy and well accepted by the subject as the time of performance is too short to lead to exhaustion. This anaerobic power is ab 3 times the aerobic power. The aerobic power is measured by stepping up and down at two fixed submaximal rates and by measuring the heart rates (f1 and f2): from this, by means of a formula or a nomogram, the maximal O2 consumption, or the aerobic power, is calculated. Both the aerobic and the anaerobic power tests involve familiar exercises that do not require training, or calibration of apparatuses, or excessive stress on the subjects. A convenient representation of the main circulatory and respiratory changes ( {Mathematical expression}, heart frequency and stroke volume. {Mathematical expression}, Hb, and others) taking place in muscular exercise at sea level and at altitude is also given. {\textcopyright} 1966 Springer-Verlag.},

In this context, alveolar ventilation (V̇a) and lung O2 transfer (Gl) are not considered to be limiting, at least at sea level, because changes in V̇a and/or in Gl are not accompanied by changes in V̇O2max due to the shape of the O2 dissociation curve. Thus, the limits of V̇O2max are shared between blood O2 transport (Fq′) and a peripheral factor. This last includes tissue O2 transfer (Ft′) and mitochondrial O2 utilization (Fm′). In untrained subjects at sea level, blood O2 transport is found to be responsible for ∼70% of the overall to limits to V̇O2max (Fq′ = 0.7), the rest depending on the peripheral factor. Fq′, a well as the sum of Ft′ and Fm′, are unchanged after training or upon return to sea level following exposure to chronic hypoxia (altitude higher than 5000 m) In the latter condition, however, since tissue O2 transfer, which sea sets Ft′ is facilitated, and mitochondrial O2 utilization, which sets Fm′, is impaired, Ft′ is reduced and Fm′ increased as compared to control condition and/or after training. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Single-breath O2 consumption (V̇O2) at the mouth and heart rate were determined in 5 healthy male subjects at rest, during 8 min of cycloergometric exercise (50, 100, 125, and 150 W), and in the recovery period following two experimental conditions: air breathing throughout (AA); hypoxic breathing (FI(O2) = 0.11) for 6 min of preexercise rest followed by air breathing from the onset of exercise (HA). The O2 deficits and debts as well as the t( 1/2 ) values of the V̇O2 on- and off-responses were determined and blood lactate concentrations measured at rest and in the recovery after 4 and 8 min of exercise. At all work loads: 1) O2 deficits were on the average 0.39 liter smaller in HA than in AA; 2) V̇O2 on-responses were faster in HA (t( 1/2 ) ≃ 7 s) than in AA (t( 1/2 ) = 20-30 s); and 3) O2 debts and V̇O2 off-responses were the same in the two conditions. Since the V̇O2 and heart rate levels at steady state as well as the blood lactate concentrations after 4 and 8 min of exercise were the same in AA and HA, the observed differences of O2 deficit cannot be attributed to changes of energy metabolism in the two conditions; they therefore depend on the reduction of body O2 stores at rest in HA. This, independently measured, was found to be 0.46 liters, not far from the observed O2 deficit difference (0.39 liters). Thus a decrease of O2 stores before exercise is accompanied by a reduction of the O2 deficit and faster V̇O2 kinetics at the onset of exercise.},

abstract = {Whether the transition in fatigue processes between "low- intensity" and "high-intensity" contractions occurs gradually, as the torque requirements are increased, or whether this transition occurs more suddenly at some identifiable "threshold", is not known. We hypothesized that the critical torque (CT; the asymptote of the torqueduration relationship) would demarcate distinct profiles of central and peripheral fatigue during intermittent isometric quadriceps contractions (3-s contraction, 2-s rest). Nine healthy men performed seven experimental trials to task failure or for up to 60 min, with maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) performed at the end of each minute. The first five trials were performed to determine CT [∼35-55% MVC, denoted severe 1 (S1) to severe 5 (S5) in ascending order], while the remaining two trials were performed 10 and 20% below the CT (denoted CT-10% and CT-20%). Dynamometer torque and the electromyogram of the right vastus lateralis were sampled continuously. Peripheral and central fatigue was determined from the fall in potentiated doublet torque and voluntary activation, respectively. Above CT, contractions progressed to task failure in ∼3-18 min, at which point the MVC did not differ from the target torque (S1 target, 88.7 ± 4.3 N m vs. MVC, 89.3 ± 8.8 N m, P = 0.94). The potentiated doublet fell significantly in all trials, and voluntary activation was reduced in trials S1-S3, but not trials S4 and S5. Below CT, contractions could be sustained for 60 min on 17 of 18 occasions. Both central and peripheral fatigue developed, but there was a substantial reserve in MVC torque at the end of the task. The rate of global and peripheral fatigue development was four to five times greater during S1 than during CT-10% (change in MVC/change in time S1 vs. CT-10%: -7.2 ± 1.4 vs. -1.5 ± 0.4 N m min-1). These results demonstrate that CT represents a critical threshold for neuromuscular fatigue development. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 the American Physiological Society.},

@article{Kistemaker2023,
abstract = {A cyclist's performance depends critically on the generated average mechanical power output (AMPO). The instantaneous mechanical power output equals the product of crank angular velocity, crank length, and the tangential pedal force. Radial pedal forces do not contribute to mechanical power. It has been suggested that radial pedal forces arise from suboptimal pedaling technique and that limiting these would increase AMPO and efficiency. Here, we presented an optimal control musculoskeletal model of a cyclist (consisting of five segments driven by nine Hill-type muscle-tendon units) to predict maximal AMPO during sprint cycling at different levels of allowed radial pedal forces. Our findings showed that limiting radial pedal forces has a detrimental effect on maximal AMPO; it dropped from 1,115 W without a limit on radial forces to 528 W when no radial forces were allowed (both at 110 rpm). We explained that avoiding radial pedal forces causes ineffective use of muscles: muscles deliver less positive power and have a higher muscle power dissipation ratio (average mechanical power dissipated per unit of average positive power delivered). We concluded that radial pedal forces are an unavoidable by-product when optimizing for maximal AMPO and that limiting these leads to a performance decrease.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In the literature, but also in the "cycling field" [e.g., trainers, coaches, and (professional) cyclists], it is often suggested that trying to limit/avoid radial pedal forces enhances cycling technique and with that maximal average power output and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce an optimal control model of a human cyclists (consisting of five segments and driven by nine Hill-type muscle-tendon complex models). With that we not only show, but also explain why limiting radial forces is a bad idea: it will decrease maximal attainable AMPO and will decrease efficiency.},

abstract = {The objectives of this study were to (1) determine whether bilateral asymmetry in cycling changed systematically with pedaling rate, (2) determine whether the dominant leg as identified by kicking contributed more to average power over a crank cycle than the other leg, and (3) determine whether the dominant leg asymmetry changed systematically with pedaling rate. To achieve these objectives, data were collected from 11 subjects who pedaled at five different pedaling rates ranging from 60 to 120rpm at a constant workrate of 260W. Bilateral pedal dynamometers measured two orthogonal force components in the plane of the bicycle. From these measurements, asymmetry was quantified by three dependent variables, the percent differences in average positive power (%AP), average negative power (%AN), and average crank power (%AC). Differences were taken for two cases - with respect to the leg generating the greater total average for each power quantity at 60rpm disregarding the measure of dominance, and with respect to the dominant leg as determined by kicking. Simple linear regression analyses were performed on these quantities both for the subject sample and for individual subjects. For the subject sample, only the percent difference in average negative power exhibited a significant linear relationship with pedaling rate; as pedaling rate increased, the asymmetry decreased. Although the kicking dominant leg contributed significantly greater average crank power than the non-dominant leg for the subject sample, the non-dominant leg contributed significantly greater average positive power and average negative power than the dominant leg. However, no significant linear relationships for any of these three quantities with pedaling rate were evident for the subject sample because of high variability in asymmetry among the subjects. For example, significant linear relationships existed between pedaling rates and percent difference in total average power per leg for only four of the 11 subjects and the nature of these relationships was different (e.g. positive versus negative slopes). It was concluded that pedaling asymmetry is highly variable among subjects and that individual subjects may exhibit different systematic changes in asymmetry with pedaling rate depending on the quantity of interest.

abstract = {The mechanical power for cycling (P(c)) at constant ground speed (s), in the absence of wind on smooth hard terrain is the sum of the power dissipated against rolling resistance, gravity and air resistance: P(c) = a {\textperiodcentered} s + M {\textperiodcentered} g {\textperiodcentered} s {\textperiodcentered} sin $\gamma$ + b {\textperiodcentered} s3, where a and b are constants, M is the mass of the subject plus bike, g is the acceleration of gravity and $\gamma$ is the angle of the terrain with the horizontal. The constant b depends upon the drag coefficient (C(d)), the overall area projected on the frontal plane (A(f)), and the air density ($\rho$(a)): b = 0.5 {\textperiodcentered} C(d) {\textperiodcentered} A(f) {\textperiodcentered} $\rho$a In turn, $\rho$(a) depends on air pressure (P(B)) and temperature (T): $\rho$(a) = p(o) {\textperiodcentered} 0.359 {\textperiodcentered} P(B) {\textperiodcentered} T-1, where $\rho$(o) is the air density at 760 mmHg (101.3kPa) and 273 K. The metabolic power developed by the cyclist (E(c)) is related to P(c) : E(c) = P(c) {\textperiodcentered} $\eta$-1, where $\eta$ is the mechanical efficiency of cycling. The experimental values of a, b and $\eta$ are fairly well known so that, if the maximal metabolic power as a function of the performance time is known for a given cyclist, the following set of data can be individually calculated: (1) best performances over any given distance and for any given altitude above sea level, (2) the effects of posture and body size on maximal speeds, and (3) the maximal incline of the terrain that can be overcome at any given speed or coasting speed for any given downslope. The above set of information makes it possible also to calculate the characteristics of a ″Twin Bikes System″ (TBS) for preventing microgravity deconditioning during long-term space flight. The TBS consists of two bicycles that are mechanically coupled by a differential gearing, which move at the very same speed, but in the opposite sense, along the inner wall of a cylindrically shaped space module. The circular trajectories induce a centrifugal acceleration vector (a(c)) oriented along the head-to-feet direction of each subject: a(c) = v(t)2 {\textperiodcentered} r-1 where v(t) is the tangential velocity and r the radius of gyration, which is equal to the inner radius of the space module. So, any desired value of a(c) can be achieved by appropriately selecting v(t), wherefrom the mechanical and metabolic powers that the astronauts must generate can be readily calculated. Experiments performed in a ground-based human centrifuge have shown that the discomfort derived from the rotating environment is reasonably low and well tolerated. If the appropriate atmospheric pressure is provided, cycling on circular or elliptical tracks may be useful to reduce cardiovascular deconditioning that occurs due to the reduced gravity in permanently manned lunar bases. Indeed, on the curved parts of the path a cyclist will generate a horizontal outward acceleration: a(c) = s2 {\textperiodcentered} r-1, where s is the velocity along the track and r is the radius of curvature. To counterbalance a(c), the subject plus bike must lean inwards so that the vectorial sum of a(c) plus the lunar gravity (g(L) = 1.62 m {\textperiodcentered} s-2) is applied along a straight line that includes the centre of mass of the system and the point of wheel contact with the ground. For values of s from 10 to 20 m {\textperiodcentered} s-1 and r from 50 to 200 m, this vectorial sum ranges from 1.05 to 5.03 g(L) (0.17-0.83 g).},

abstract = {The definition of efficiency of human movement has often been unable to cope with activities such as level gait because the numerator of the efficiency equation includes only external work done by the body on an external load. The major purpose of this paper is to propose a definition that not only accounts for any external work but also for the internal work done by the limbs themselves. The internal work involves a new biomechanical analysis that takes into account all potential and kinetic energy components, all exchanges of energy within and between segments and both positive and negative work done by the muscles. This analysis was applied to a study of overground level gait on eight subjects walking at different walking speeds. The interal work/stride as calculated from the sum of segment energies was compared with the same calculation on the body's center of mass energy. The latter was found to be in error (low) by 16.2% and could be low by as much as 40%. The average internal work per body mass per distance walked was 1.09 J/kg x m.},

abstract = {Background. The maximum post exercise blood lactate concentration (BLC max) has been positively correlated with maximal short-term exercise (MSE) performance. However, the moment when BLCmax occurs (TBLC max) is rather unpredictable and interpretation of BLC response to MSE is therefore difficult. Methods. We compared a 3- and a 4-parameter model for the analysis of the dynamics of BLC response to MSEs lasting 10 (MSE10) and 30 s (MSE30) in eleven males (24.6 ± 2.3 yrs; 182.4 ± 6.8 cm; 75.1 ± 9.4 kg). The 3-parameter model uses BLC at MSE-start, extra-vascular increase (A) and rate constants of BLC appearance (k1) and disappearance (k2). The 4-parameter model includes BLC at MSE termination and amplitudes and rate constants of increase (A1, y 1) and decrease (A2, y2) of post MSE-BLC. Results. Both models consistently explained 93.69 % or more of the variance of individual BLC responses. Reduction of the number of parameters decreased (p < 0.05) the goodness of the fit in every MSE10 and in 3 MSE30. A (9.1 ± 2.1 vs. 15.3 ± 2.1 mmol l-1) and A1(7.1 ± 1.6 vs. 10.9 ± 2.0 mmol l-1) were lower (p < 0.05) in MSE10 than in MSE30. k1(0.610 ± 0.119 vs. 0.505 ± 0.107 min-1), k2(4.21 10-2 ± 1.06 10-2 vs. 2.45 10-2 ± 1.04 10-2 min -1), and A2(-563.8 ± 370.8 vs. -1412.6 ± 868.8 mmol l-1), and y1(0.579 ± 0.137 vs. 0.489 ± 0.076 min-1) were higher (p < 0.05) in MSE10 than in MSE30. No corresponding difference in y2(0.41 10-2 ± 0.82 10-2 vs. 0.15 10-2 ± 0.42 10 -2 min-1) was found. Conclusion. The 3-parameter model estimates of lactate appearance and disappearance were sensitive to differences in test duration and support an interrelation between BLC level and halftime of lactate elimination previously found. The 4-parameter model results support the 3-parameter model findings about lactate appearance; however, parameter estimates for lactate disappearance were unrealistic in the 4-parameter model. The 3-parameter model provides useful information about the dynamics of the lactate response to MSE. {\textcopyright} 2007 Beneke et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The equations were used to calculate the expected concentrations of free ATP, ADP, and AMP as high energy phosphate is discharged by a representative muscle. Arguments are advanced for the validity of the results as an estimate of in vivo conditions when based only on measured concentrations of phosphocreatine, creatine, and total adenosine phosphates. Changes in phosphocreatine concentration cause rapid changes in the calculated concentrations of ADP and AMP that are consistent with postulated regulatory effects of these compounds on the Embden Meyerhof pathway. The amount of ADP and AMP formed by a given discharge of high energy phosphate depends upon the H+ concentration, and physiological changes in pH are sufficient to cause significant changes in the rate of glycolysis in this way. The physiological significance of phosphocreatine as an effector is less clear.},

abstract = {In competitive swimming, as in other competitive sports, lactate tests are commonly applied not only to describe the current metabolic performance of the swimmer but also to define appropriate training goals, intensity and volume, to monitor metabolic adaptations to training and to adjust the training periodisation in order to increase the training efficiency. Mader ([42], [44]) argued in a mathematical model of metabolic energy supply that beside the aerobic activity the lactate production also strongly affects the lactate-speed relation. This finding can explain a lot of contradictory interpretations ([28]) and paradoxes between the evaluation of lactate tests and the performances in competition and/or in training, but it also stresses the importance of examining and considering both the aerobic and anaerobic metabolic components together in order to ensure a reliable implementation of lactate test results ([56]). In the last 20 years, more basic studies support this rather theoretical approach and provide better insight in different factors, other than O2-limitation for contraction, that affect blood lactate concentrations during exercise ([19], [20]). Beside its metabolic metamorphosis, being upgraded from a glycolitic waste product to an important intermediate that helps regulating the metabolic activity, lactate has newly been described as a signalling molecule ([62]) between respectively the metabolic and nervous system and the metabolic and gene expression system. However these finding certainly need more research before any evidence based application in training. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Swimming performance in triathlon gradually gets of overriding importance in view of the final positioning in a race. It is important to end up swimming in the leading group(s) and to consider the impact of the swim stage on the 2 remaining sports disciplines in order to outbalance the athlete's effort and to be able to keep racing for a good position until the end of the race. Unlike cycling and running where the performance mainly depends on conditioning, the performance in swimming is a subtle combination of conditioning and technical abilities. Even elite swimmers may lose a lot of performance if their outstanding conditioning is not coupled with an excellent swimming technique. Triathletes very often suffer from a lack of technique and despite the wetsuit, which partially outbalances this shortcoming, they spend a lot of energy in the swim stage without reaping any success, energy which is then not on hand anymore for the rest of the race. Therefore, swimming technique should be the groundwork in the multi-year planning AND should be focussed on in each training session during the whole carrier of the triathlete. Monitoring the combination of time/stroke rate/stroke length is thus a must. Periodisation in triathlon is much more complex than in "single" sports. Not only the sports specific weaknesses/strengths of the athlete but also the intrinsic interaction between cycling, running and swimming on training effects and his swim-technical qualities will rule the periodisation. Additionally the level of technique will also set volume, intensity and form of training exercises. Simple to complex tests can help to make the right choice. This makes from triathlon an exciting sport, not only for the athlete but also for the coach and supporting teams. This article will summarise some practical implications on periodisation and on swimming training in triathlon.},

abstract = {A mathematical description of the regulation of ATP production in muscle cells is presented whereby the activity of OxP can be calculated as a function of (1) free [ADP] as the substrate and (2) a second driving force $\Phi$$\Delta$G (kilojoules per mole) resulting from the difference of free energy $\Delta$Gox,ap (kilojoules per mole) - $\Delta$GATP,cyt (kilojoules per mole). In turn, the term $\Delta$Gox,ap results from the proton motive force and the generation of ATP in the matrix space including the ATP-ADP exchange, whereas the phosphorylation state of the CHEP-sytem is described by $\Delta$GATP,cyt. Regulation of glycolysis is calculated as a function of free [ADP] and [AMP] at the level of PFK. The PFK is inhibited by a decreasing pH resulting from lactate accumulation. The ATP/PCr equilibrium of the CHEP-system is calculated by algebraic equations. The dynamic behaviour of the metabolic control of ATP production as a function of ATP consumption is calculated by a system of two 1st-order non-linear differential equations, including a time delay considering oxygen transport. Lactate distribution and elimination is calculated using a two-compartment model with an active lactate producing, and a passive, space including lactate elimination by combustion. The simulation of the dynamics of energy metabolism of muscle cells is performed by the stepwise solution of the differential equations with a 5th-order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg-routine. Examples of various applications of the simulation of the dynamics of energy supply demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative congruence to the behaviour of metabolic processes in experiments during rest, exercise and recovery.},

abstract = {Interventions aimed at increasing fat metabolism could potentially reduce the symptoms of metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes and may have tremendous clinical relevance. Hence, an understanding of the factors that increase or decrease fat oxidation is important. Exercise intensity and duration are important determinants of fat oxidation. Fat oxidation rates increase from low to moderate intensities and then decrease when the intensity becomes high. Maximal rates of fat oxidation have been shown to be reached at intensities between 59% and 64% of maximum oxygen consumption in trained individuals and between 47% and 52% of maximum oxygen consumption in a large sample of the general population. The mode of exercise can also affect fat oxidation, with fat oxidation being higher during running than cycling. Endurance training induces a multitude of adaptations that result in increased fat oxidation. The duration and intensity of exercise training required to induce changes in fat oxidation is currently unknown. Ingestion of carbohydrate in the hours before or on commencement of exercise reduces the rate of fat oxidation significantly compared with fasted conditions, whereas fasting longer than 6 h optimizes fat oxidation. Fat oxidation rates have been shown to decrease after ingestion of high-fat diets, partly as a result of decreased glycogen stores and partly because of adaptations at the muscle level. {\textcopyright} Elsevier Inc. 2004.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The balance between protein synthesis and degradation, and between active skeletal muscle cell hypertrophy and atrophy can be described as a function of protein degradation rate by a transcription-translation activation control loop. Transcription activity is presumed to be determined by the concentration of protein-specific fragments (PSF) occurring as intermediate products of protein degradation. If PSF acts as an apoinducer at the gene or operon enhancer region, formation and dissociation of PSF-enhancer complex, as a function of PSF concentration, determines the gene or operon transcription activity. The assumed regulation can be converted to a mathematical model that allows simulation of steady-state protein balance and active adaptation, according to the level of functional activity. The relationship between steady-state transcription activity and PSF concentration can be described by Michaelis-Menten or weak sigmoidicity kinetics. Similar dependency is presumed in translation activity as a function of mRNA concentration. The relationship of protein to mRNA, PSF and ribosome content, and their formation and degradation, are determined by first-order differential equations. The assumed regulation scheme may also contribute to the theory of transcription activation, and can be used to explain the mechanism determining active adaptation in living systems. {\textcopyright} 1988 Academic Press Limited.},

abstract = {Anaerobic energy release is of great importance for shortlasting exercise but has been difficult to quantify. In order to determine the amount of anaerobic anergy release during shortlasting exercise we let 17 healthy young males exercise on the ergometer bike to exhaustion. The power during exercise was kept constant and selected to cause exhaustion in $\sim$30 s, 1 min, or 2-3 min. The O2 uptake was measured continuously during the exercise, and the anaerobic energy release was quantified by the accumulated O2 deficit. The work done as well as the total energy release rose linearly with the exercise duration and was therefore a sum of a component proportional to time plus a constant addition. The accumulated O2 deficit increased from 1.86 ± 0.07 (SE) mmol/kg for 30 s exercise to 2.25 ± 0.06 mmol/kg for 1 min exercise and further to 2.42 ± 0.08 mmol/kg for exercise lasting 2 min or more (P < 0.01). The accumulated O2 uptake increased linearly with the duration, and as a consequence of this the relative importance of aerobic processes increased from 40% at 30 s duration to 50% at 1 min duration and further to 65% for exercise lasting 2 min. These results show that both aerobic and anaerobic processes contribute significantly during intense exercise lasting from 30 s to 3 min.},

abstract = {1991. In this study we evaluated the physiological and biomechanical responses of “elite-national class” (i.e., group 1; N =9) and “good-state class” (i.e., group 2; N = 6) cyclists while they simulated a 40 km time-trial in the laboratory by cycling on an ergometer for 1 h at their highest power output. Actual road racing 40 km time-trial performance was highly correlated with average absolute power during the 1 h laboratory performance test (r = -0.88; P < 0.001). In turn, 1 h power output was related to each cyclists' VO2 at the blood lactate threshold (r = 0.93; P < 0.001). Group 1 was not different from group 2 regarding VO2max(approximately 70 ml{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1 and 5.01 1.min-1) or lean body weight. However, group 1 bicycled 40 km on the road 10% faster than group 2 (P < 0.05; 54 vs 60 min). Additionally, group 1 was able to generate 11 % more power during the 1 h performance test than group 2 (P < 0.05), and they averaged 90 ± 1% VO2max compared with 86 ± 2% VO2max in group 2(P= 0.06). The higher performance power output of group 1 was produced primarily by generating higher peak torques about the center of the crank by applying larger vertical forces to the crank arm during the cycling downstroke. Compared with group 2, group 1 also produced higher peak torques and vertical forces during the downstroke even when cycling at the same absolute work rate as group 2. Factors possibly contributing to the ability of group 1 to produce higher “downstroke power” are a greater percentage of Type I muscle fibers (P < 0.05) and a 23% greater (P < 0.05) muscle capillary density compared with group 2. We have also observed a strong relationship between years of endurance training and percent Type I muscle fibers (r = 0.75; P < 0.001). It appears that “elite national class” cyclists have the ability to generate higher “downstroke power”, possibly as a result of muscular adaptations stimulated by more years of endurance training. {\textcopyright} 1991 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

In a repeated-measures crossover design, ten active men (aged 21.5 ± 1.5 years, exercising >3 times per week) performed four bouts of 10-s cycle ergometer sprints with interbout FC at 10°C water for 2.5 min or non-cooling (NC) with a 5-day interval. The results indicated that FC elicited higher total work (27.57 ± 5.66 kJ vs. 26.55 ± 5.76 kJ) and arousal scores than NC (p < 0.05). Furthermore, under the NC condition, participants decreased mean power (p < 0.05) with no alteration of vastus lateralis (VL) electromyography (EMG) activities after the second bout; whereas under the FC condition, participants maintained steady mean power accompanied by increased VL EMG activities in the last two bouts (p < 0.05). Jointly, participants had higher mean power ([3rd = 10.14 ± 1.15 vs. 9.37 ± 1.30; 4th= 9.79 ± 1.22 vs. 9.23 ± 1.27] W/kg) and VL EMG activities in the last two bouts under the FC than NC condition (p < 0.05). However, perceived exertion and the heart rate were comparable between the two conditions (p > 0.05). In conclusion, interbout FC elicited a higher arousal level and repeated lower limb power performance, which could be explained by delaying peripheral fatigue via increasing excitatory drive and recruiting additional motor units to compensate for fatigue-related responses and power decrements.},

The following hypotheses were therefore tested: (1) the standing position results in better performance at a high power output, while (2) the seated position is best at a moderate power output. We also assessed the seated-standing transition intensity, above which seated cycling should be superseded by standing cycling for maximization of performance. Ten male cyclists (mean age 27 years, s = 3; height 1.82 m, s = 0.07; body mass 75.2 kg, s = 7.0; VO2max 70.0 ml {\textperiodcentered} kg-1 {\textperiodcentered} min-1, s = 5.2) performed seated and standing treadmill cycling to exhaustion at 10% grade and at four power outputs ranging from 86% to 165% of their power output at maximal oxygen uptake (max). Power output at maximal oxygen uptake was obtained during determination of VO2max. There was no difference in time to exhaustion between the two cycling positions at 86% of Wmax (P = 0.29). All participants performed best at the highest power output (165% of Wmax) when standing (P = 0.002). An overall seated-standing transition intensity of 94% of Wmax was identified. Thus, in general, cyclists may choose either the standing or seated position for maximization of performance at a submaximal intensity of 86% of Wmax, while the standing position should be used at intensities above 94% of Wmax and approaching 165% of Wmax.},

abstract = {The so-called excess-CO2 in physical exertion results stoichiometrically directly from the quantity of protons bound in bicarbonate buffering. This situation is used in determining the ventilatory threshold (VT). However, the extent to which the degree and increase characteristics of excess-CO2 can be used as an equivalent to blood lactate concentrations is uncertain. To investigate this relationship, 21 healthy men exercised on a cycle ergometer (starting at 50 watt, increases of 50 watt every 3 minutes) to subjective exhaustion. To evaluate the characteristics of this increase, a slope constant $\lambda$ was calculated in relation to performance for both the blood lactate concentration ($\lambda$ lactate) and the cumulated excess-CO2 ($\lambda$ CO2excess). The start of the lactate increase (LT) and excess-CO2 (VT) showed good intercorrelation (VT = 2.27 ± 0.98{\textperiodcentered}LT; r = 0.914; P < 0.001). Mean $\lambda$ lactate and $\lambda$ CO2 excess were of similar dimensions in all subjects (69.3 ± 39.8 watt vs. 80.11 ± 15.7 watt), but a minority of the subjects (n = 7) showed a considerably more gradual increase for the excess-CO2 to the maximum. Since in addition there was no significant correlation between the absolute values for maximum lactate concentrations and the cumulative excess-CO2, an interindividual prediction of lactate concentrations from the excess-CO2 would be difficult. It is an open question, however, whether perhaps additional performance-limiting factors, such as the ventilation or the buffering capacity, may be included when measuring the excess-CO2 so that this parameter could be more a measure for the formation rate of new lactate than the blood lactate concentration alone.},

While max {Mathematical expression} is an index of the power of aerobic energy output, max O2D assesses the capacity of anaerobic sources. For a comprehensive assessment of physical working capacity of athletes, both aerobic and anaerobic capabilities should be represented in three dimensions, i.e. in indexes of power, capacity and efficiency. Experimental procedures have been developed for assessing these three parameters in treadmill running tests. It is proposed to assess anaerobic power by measuring excess CO2, concurrently with determination of max {Mathematical expression}. Maximal aerobic capacity is established as the product of max {Mathematical expression} by the time of max {Mathematical expression} maintenance determined in a special test with running at critical speed. The ergometric criteria derived on the basis of the tests proposed, may be used for systematization of various physical work loads. {\textcopyright} 1975 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Controversies exist regarding quantification of internal power (IP) generated by the muscles to overcome energy changes of moving body segments when external power (EP) is performed. The aim was to 1) use a kinematic model for estimation of IP during knee extension, 2) validate the model by independent calculation of IP from metabolic variables (IPmet), and 3) analyze the relationship between total power (TP = EP + IP) and physiological responses. IP increased in a curvilinear manner (5, 7, 13, 21, and 34 W) with contraction rate (45, 60, 75, 90, and 105 contrations/min), but it was independent of EP. Correspondingly, IPmet was 5, 7, 10, 19, and 28 W, supporting the kinematic model. Heart rate, pulmonary oxygen uptake, and leg blood flow plotted vs. TP fell on the same line independent of contraction rate, and muscular mechanical efficiency as well as delta efficiency remained remarkably constant across contraction rates. It is concluded that the novel metabolic validation of the kinematic model supports the model assumptions, and physiological responses proved to be closely related to TP, supporting the legitimacy of IP estimates.},

abstract = {One objective of this study was to investigate whether neuromuscular quantities were associated with preferred pedaling rate selection during submaximal steady-state cycling from a theoretical perspective using a musculoskeletal model with an optimal control analysis. Specific neuromuscular quantities of interest were the individual muscle activation, force, stress and endurance. To achieve this objective, a forward dynamic model of cycling and optimization framework were used to simulate pedaling at three different rates of 75, 90 and 105 rpm at 265 W. The pedaling simulations were produced by optimizing the individual muscle excitation timing and magnitude to reproduce experimentally collected data. The results from these pedaling simulations indicated that all neuromuscular quantities were minimized at 90 rpm when summed across muscles. In the context of endurance cycling, these results suggest that minimizing neuromuscular fatigue is an important mechanism in pedaling rate selection. A second objective was to determine whether any of these quantities could be used to predict the preferred pedaling rate. By using the quantities with the strongest quadratic trends as the performance criterion to be minimized in an optimal control analysis, these quantities were analyzed to assess whether they could be further minimized at 90 rpm and produce normal pedaling mechanics. The results showed that both the integrated muscle activation and average endurance summed across all muscles could be further minimized at 90 rpm indicating that these quantities cannot be used individually to predict preferred pedaling rates.},

abstract = {Several studies have suggested that the most economical cadence in cycling increases with increasing workload. However, none of these studies have been able to demonstrate this relationship with experimental data. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the most economical cadence in elite cyclists increases with increasing workload and to explore the effect of cadence on performance. Six elite road cyclists performed submaximal and maximal tests at four different cadences (60, 80, 100 and 120 rpm) on separate days. Respiratory data was measured at 0, 50, 125, 200, 275 and 350 W during the submaximal test and at the end of the maximal test. The maximal test was carried out as an incremental test, conducted to reveal differences in maximal oxygen uptake and time to exhaustion (short-term performance) between cadences. The results showed that the lowest oxygen uptake, i.e. the best work economy, shifted from 60 rpm at 0 W to 80 rpm at 350 W (P<0.05). No difference was found in maximal oxygen uptake among cadences (P>0.05), while the best performance was attained at the same cadence that elicited the best work economy (80 rpm) at 350 W (P<0.05). This study demonstrated that the most economical cadence increases with increasing workload in elite cyclists. It was further shown that work economy and performance are related during short efforts (∼5 min) over a wide range of cadences. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

While some studies have shown that EPOC may last for several hours after exercise, others have concluded that EPOC is transient and minimal. The conflicting results may be resolved if differences in exercise intensity and duration are considered, since this may affect the metabolic processes underlying EPOC. Accordingly, the absence of a sustained EPOC after exercise seems to be a consistent finding in studies with low exercise intensity and/or duration. The magnitude of EPOC after aerobic exercise clearly depends on both the duration and intensity of exercise. A curvilinear relationship between the magnitude of EPOC and the intensity of the exercise bout has been found, whereas the relationship between exercise duration and EPOC magnitude appears to be more linear, especially at higher intensities. Differences in exercise mode may potentially contribute to the discrepant findings of EPOC magnitude and duration. Studies with sufficient exercise challenges are needed to determine whether various aerobic exercise modes affect EPOC differently. The relationships between the intensity and duration of resistance exercise and the magnitude and duration of EPOC have not been determined, but a more prolonged and substantial EPOC has been found after hard- versus moderate-resistance exercise. Thus, the intensity of resistance exercise seems to be of importance for EPOC. Lastly, training status and sex may also potentially influence EPOC magnitude, but this may be problematic to determine. Still, it appears that trained individuals have a more rapid return of post-exercise metabolism to resting levels after exercising at either the same relative or absolute work rate; however, studies after more strenuous exercise bouts are needed. It is not determined if there is a sex effect on EPOC. Finally, while some of the mechanisms underlying the more rapid EPOC are well known (replenishment of oxygen stores, adenosine triphosphate/creatine phosphate resynthesis, lactate removal, and increased body temperature, circulation and ventilation), less is known about the mechanisms underlying the prolonged EPOC component.

An increased rate of triglyceride/fatty acid cycling and a shift from carbohydrate to fat as substrate source are of importance for the prolonged EPOC component after exhaustive aerobic exercise.

@article{Gaesser1984,
abstract = {The classical “oxygen debt” hypothesis formulated by Hill and associates in the 1920s was an attempt to link the metabolism of lactic acid with the O2 consumption in excess of resting that occurs after exercise. The O2 debt was hypothesized to represent the oxidation of a minor fraction (1/5) of the lactate formed during exercise, to provide the energy to reconvert the remainder (4/5) of the lactate to glycogen during recovery. In 1933 Margaria et al. modified this hypothesis by distinguishing between intial, fast (“alactacid”), and second, slow (“lactacid”), O2-debt curve components. They hypothesized that the fast phase of the post-exercise O2 consumption curve was due to the restoration of phosphagen (ATP + CP). It is now probable that the original lactic acid explanation of the O2 debt was too simplistic. Numerous studies on several species have provided evidence demonstrating a dissociation between the kinetics of lactate removal and the slow component of the post-exercise V̇o2. The metabolism of lactate, a readily oxidizable substrate, following exercise appears to be directed primarily toward energy production in mitochondria. The elevated concentration of lactate present at the end of exercise may be viewed as a “reservoir of carbon,” which may serve as a source of oxidative ATP production or as a source of carbon skeletons for the synthesis of glucose, glycogen, amino acids, and TCA cycle intermediates. The metabolic basis of the elevated post-exercise V̇o2 may be understood in terms of those factors which directly or indirectly influence mitochondrial O2 consumption. Included among these factors are catecholamines, thyroxine, glucocorticoids, fatty acids, calcium ions, and temperature. Of these, elevated temperature is perhaps the most important. As no complete explanation of the post-exercise metabolism exists, it is recommended that the term “O2 debt” be used to describe a set of phenomena during recovery from exercise. The terms “alactacid debt” and “lactacid debt,” which suggest a mechanism, are inappropriate. Use of alternative terms, e.g., “excess post-exercise oxygen” consumption“ (EPOC) and ”recovery O2,“ will avoid implication of causality in describing the elevation in metabolic rate above resting levels after exercise. {\textcopyright}1984The American College of Sports Medicine},

The rate of increase of lactic acid is higher in the less fit than in the athletic subjects, to compensate for the lower oxygen consumption. In all subjects the appearance of L.A. in the blood is delayed: at the onset of the exercise other anaerobic processes (alactic) supply the energy required, and only when these are exhausted L.A. formation enters into play. The energy due to lactic acid corresponds to 37±3.5 ml of O2 per g of lactic acid increase in 1 l of blood, or 50 ml of O2 (or 250 cal) per g of L.A. produced from glycogen. The maximal amount of the lactacid debt is equivalent to about the maximum oxygen consumption in 1 min.

Eighteen men exercised at 50, 65, and 80% of maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) for 5 and 20 min. Each exercise bout was preceded and followed by cycling at 150 kpm. min-1, which established the base-line VO2 used in this study. The magnitude of the rapid component of recovery O2 was proportional to exercise intensity and was not altered by exercise duration. The slow component of recovery O2 was not significantly altered by exercise intensity or duration at 50 and 65% of VO2 max. However, after 20 min of exercise at 80% of VO2 max, the slow component of recovery O2 was 5 times (P < 0.01) larger than after the 5-min exercise at 80% of VO2max. End-exercise blood lactate level was also higher after the 20-min bout at 80% of VO2 max; however, at most, 30% of the difference between the magnitude of the slow components of recovery O2 after the 5- and 20-min rides at 80% of VO2max could be accounted for by lactate metabolism. The Q10 effect of temperature on metabolism could account for 60-70% of the slow component of recovery O2 at all work rates and durations. It could also account for the remaining 70% of the increase in the slow component after the 20-min exercise at 80% of VO2 max.},

Fifteen healthy subjects (24.0±3.5 years, 180.5±6.1 cm, 75.4±11.9 kg) performed a WAnT on ME, and EE 3 days apart. Performance was measured as peak power (PP), minimum power (MP), mean power (AP), time to PP (TTPP), fatigue rate (FR), and maximum cadence (RPMMAX). Lactic (WLAC) and alactic (WPCR) anaerobic energy were calculated from net lactate appearance and the fast component of post-exercise oxygen uptake. Aerobic metabolism (WAER) was calculated from oxygen uptake during the WAnT. Total energy cost (WTOT) was calculated as the sum of WLAC, WPCR, and WAER. There was no difference between ME and EE in PP (873±159 vs. 931±193 W) or AP (633±89 vs. 630±89 W). In the EE condition TTPP (2.3±0.7 vs. 4.3±0.7 s) was longer (P<0.001), MP (464±78 vs. 388±57 W) was lower (P<0.001), FR (15.2±5.2 vs. 20.5±6.8%) was higher (P<0.005), and RPMMAX (168±18 vs. 128±15 rpm) was slower (P<0.001).

abstract = {New technology allows cyclists to train via power output (PO) in addition to heart rate (HR). For those athletes undertaking seasonal laboratory testing (e.g., V̇O2, lactate threshold), it is imperative that athletes be able to directly apply this information to their training device. We examined the reliability of a standardized laboratory ergometer (Lode Excalibur Sport) and its applicability to an electromagnetically braked ergometer (Computrainer) in 2 phases. Phase I (n = 12) examined the reliability of the Lode. Phase II (n = 14) compared the Lode to the Computrainer using a randomized, counterbalance assignment. Following warm-up, each trial started at 100 W, progressing 50 W every 3 minutes to exhaustion. Outcomes were time-to-exhaustion (TTE), peak PO (W) (POpeak), peak HR (HRpeak), and ventilatory (VT) and respiratory compensation (RCP) thresholds. We used a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey post hoc analysis, regression analysis, Bland-Altman plots, and coefficient of variation (CV) analysis for each variable. During phase I, we found no significant difference for any variable, minimal dispersion of V̇O2 during Bland-Altman analysis, and a low CV at each test stage (≤ 5%). During phase II, significant differences and higher CV for most parameters (all data; p < 0.001) were observed for Lode versus Computrainer: TTE (21 minutes, 12 seconds ± 3 minutes, 12 seconds vs. 19 minutes, 9 seconds ± 2 minutes, 36 seconds; CV = 16%), POpeak (335 ± 57.8 W vs. 295 ± 47.1 W, CV = 17%), as well as PO at VT (CV = 51%) and RCP (CV = 24%; p < 0.01). We conclude that coaches and cyclists may need to use some caution when directly transferring results obtained from laboratory testing to the Computrainer training device. {\textcopyright} 2005 National Strength & Conditioning Association.},

abstract = {Although multiple testing devices advertise Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnT), capability, reliability, and validity data are sparse. The purpose was to determine whether the Lode Excalibur Sport cycle ergometer is a reliable and valid instrument to conduct the 30-second WAnT when compared with the Monark 894e Peak Bike ergometer. Recreationally active men (n=49; 20.6±2.5 years; 1.75±0.07 m; and 79.1±9.8 kg) completed four 30-second WAnTs: 2 each on the Lode and the Monark ergometers for peak power (PP), mean power (MP), minimum power (MinP), fatigue index (FI), and peak cadence (vmax) measurement. Interday and interunit correlation, multivariate analysis of variance, regression, and Bland-Altman analysis determined reliability and validity. Cohen's d was used to determine effect size. Relative reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient) with 95% confidence interval for Monark and Lode was very high for PP, MP, MinP, and vmax and high for FI (r> 0.83; coefficient of variation ≤ 27.0%; p < 0.01). Interunit correlation was strong for PP, MP, MinP, and vmax (r > 0.75; p < 0.001) and moderate for FI (p = 0.001). Lode PP and FI values were significantly less (p < 0.001; d > 1.18) and MinP, MP, and vmax significantly greater (p < 0.001; d > 0.51) than Monark. Proportional bias was demonstrated for all variables (p, 0.04; d . 2.68) except vmax. The Lode ergometer reliably provides WAnT outcomes and correlates well to the Monark ergometer. However, differences in power values and proportional bias between differently braked instruments prevent use of the Lode ergometer for comparison of WAnT data with normative data generated by the Monark ergometer.

Repeated measures using a Gas Exchange System Validator (GESV) across a range of simulated metabolic rates, showed the MM3B to be adequately reliable (both percentage errors, and percentage technical error of measurements <2%) for measuring expired ventilation (V E), oxygen consumption (VO 2), and carbon dioxide production (VCO 2). Over a 3 h period, the MM3B was shown to be acceptably stable in measuring gas fractions, as well as V E, VO 2, and VCO 2 generated by the GESV, especially at moderate and high metabolic rates (drifts <2% and of minor physiological significance). Using eight healthy adolescents during rest, moderate, and vigorous cycle ergometry, the validity of the MM3B was tested against the primary criterion Douglas bag method (DBM) and a secondary criterion machine known to be accurate, the Jaeger Oxycon Pro system. No significant errors in V E were noted, yet the MM3B significantly overestimated both VO 2 and VCO 2 by approximately 10-17% at moderate and vigorous exercise as compared to the DBM and at all exercise levels compared to the Oxycon Pro. No significant differences were seen in any metabolic variable between the two criterion systems (DBM and Oxycon Pro). It is concluded the MM3B produces acceptably stable and reliable results, but is not adequately valid during moderate and vigorous exercise without some further correction of VO 2 and VCO 2. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2011.

Healthy subjects ran on the treadmill or bicycled on ergometers while the O2 uptake was measured by the Metamaxes and also by the Douglas bag technique or the Vmax 29 instrument. In the first series of experiments, O2 uptake was measured by each instrument in turn. In later experiments two or more breathing valves were connected in a series, thus enabling measurement of the O2 uptake simultaneously by more than one instrument. The O2 uptake measured by the Metamax analysers rose linearly by the value given by the control methods. However, there were variations of ≈5% because the relationships differed between subjects. When the data from each subject were examined separately, the error of regression was 0.5-1 $\mu$mol s-1 kg-1 (2-3%), and the error of regression when relating the O2 uptake to the exercise intensity was similar to that found when using the Douglas bag technique alone. In most cases the lung ventilation reported by the Metamaxes was a few percent less than that given by the control methods, while the fractional extraction of O2 was higher for the Metamaxes. The respiratory exchange ratios (R-value) reported by the Metamaxes were in good agreement with those of the control methods in the range 0.9-1.0 only; for this parameter, the Metamaxes do not seem to be reliable for exercise testing. The O2 uptake and the R-value were also calculated from the raw data reported by the Metamaxes. The calculated values differed somewhat from those reported by the instruments, and the calculated values were more in agreement with those obtained by the Douglas bag technique than those reported by the instrument.

abstract = {Sprint races in track cycling are characterised by maximal power requirements and high-power output over 15 to 75 s. As competition rules limit the athlete to a single gear, the choice of gear ratio has considerable impact on performance. Traditionally, a gear favouring short start times and rapid acceleration, i.e., lower transmission ratios, was chosen. In recent years, track cyclists tended to choose higher gear ratios instead. Based on a review of the relevant literature, we aimed to provide an explanation for that increase in the gear ratio chosen and apply this to a 1000 m time trial. Race data with continuous measurements of crank force and velocity of an elite track cyclist were analysed retrospectively regarding the influence of the selected gear on power, cadence and resulting speed. For this purpose, time-dependent maximal force-velocity (F/v) profiles were used to describe changes in performance with increasing fatigue. By applying these profiles to a physical model of track cycling, theoretical power output, cadence and resulting speed were calculated for different scenarios. Based on previous research results, we assume a systematic and predictable decline in optimal cadence with increasing fatigue. The choice of higher gear ratios seems to be explained physiologically by the successive reduction in optimal cadence as fatigue sets in. Our approach indicates that average power output can be significantly increased by selecting a gear ratio that minimises the difference between the realised cadence and the time-dependent dynamic optimum. In view of the additional effects of the gear selection on acceleration and speed, gear selection should optimally meet the various requirements of the respective sprint event.},

abstract = {Background: During maximal cycling sprints, efficiency ($\eta$) is determined by the fiber composition of the muscles activated and cadence-dependent power output. To date, due to methodological limitations, it has only been possible to calculate gross efficiency (i.e., the ratio of total mechanical to total metabolic work) in vivo without assessing the impact of cadence and changes during exercise. Eliminating the impact of cadence provides optimal efficiency ($\eta$opt), which can be modeled as a function of time. Here, we explain this concept, demonstrate its calculation, and compare the values obtained to actual data. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the time course of maximal power output (Pmax) reflects time-dependent changes in $\eta$opt. Methods: Twelve elite track cyclists performed four maximal sprints (3, 8, 12, 60 s) and a maximal-pedaling test on a cycle ergometer. Crank force and cadence were monitored continuously to determine fatigue-free force-velocity profiles (F/v) and fatigue-induced changes in Pmax. Respiratory gases were measured during and for 30 min post-exercise. Prior to and following each sprint, lactate in capillary blood was determined to calculate net blood lactate accumulation ($\Delta$BLC). Lactic and alactic energy production were estimated from $\Delta$BLC and the fast component of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption. Aerobic energy production was determined from oxygen uptake during exercise. Metabolic power (MP) was derived from total metabolic energy (WTOT). $\eta$opt was calculated as Pmax divided by MP. Temporal changes in Pmax, WTOT, and $\eta$opt were analyzed by non-linear regression. Results: All models showed excellent quality (R2 > 0.982) and allowed accurate recalculation of time-specific power output and gross efficiency (R2 > 0.986). The time-constant for Pmax(t) ($\tau$P) was closely correlated with that of $\eta$opt ($\tau$$\eta$; r = 0.998, p < 0.001). Estimating efficiency using $\tau$P for $\tau$$\eta$ led to a 0.88 ± 0.35% error. Conclusions: Although efficiency depends on pedal force and cadence, the latter influence can be eliminated by $\eta$opt(t) using a mono-exponential equation whose time constant can be estimated from Pmax(t).},

abstract = {Functional threshold power (FTP) has emerged as a correlate of lactate threshold and is commonly assessed by recreational and professional cyclists for tailored exercise programing. To identify whether results from traditional aerobic and anaerobic cycling tests could predict FTP and Vo2max, we analyzed the association between estimated FTP, maximum oxygen uptake (Vo2max [ml{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1]) and power outputs obtained from a maximal cycle ergometry cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), and a 30-second Wingate test in a heterogeneous cohort of cycle-trained and untrained individuals (N = 40, mean ± SD; age: 32.6 ± 10.6 years; relative Vo2max: 46.8 ± 9.1 ml{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1). The accuracy and sensitivity of the prediction equations were also assessed in young men (N = 11) before and after a 6-week sprint interval training intervention. Moderate-to-strong positive correlations were observed between FTP, relative Vo2max, and power outputs achieved during incremental and 30-second Wingate cycling tests (r = 0.39-0.965, all p ≤.05). Whilst maximum power achieved during incremental cycle testing (Pmax) and relative Vo2max were predictors of FTP (r2 = 0.93), age and FTP (W{\textperiodcentered}kg-1) estimated relative Vo2max (r2 = 0.80). Our findings confirm that FTP predominantly relies on aerobic metabolism and indicate that both prediction models are sensitive enough to detect meaningful exercise-induced changes in FTP and Vo2max. Thus, coaches should consider limiting the time and load demands placed on athletes by conducting a maximal cycle ergometry CPET to estimate FTP. In addition, a 20-minute FTP test is a convenient method to assess Vo2max and is particularly relevant for exercise professionals without access to expensive CPET equipment.},

abstract = {Purposeː Cycling performance is the results of the interplay among a wide range of variables.  Different methodological approaches have been described during last 50 years in order to evaluate and understand cycling performance. Our main aim was to systematically review the applications of muscle oximetry in cycling performance assessment. Methods: A structured search was carried out following the PRISMA guidelines in MEDLINE{\textregistered}/PubMed and Scopus databases were searched with additional integration from external sources, between 1 February and 31 March 2020. To meet the inclusion criteria studies published from 2000 to 2020 and that applied muscle oxygen saturation analysis to investigate cyclists' performance were selected. This review included studies with experimental designs. There were no filters applied to the cyclists' level, sex, ray or age. Results: Starting from the 955 identified records, 21 items were finally included for the review. Three main investigation topics, related to application of muscle oximetry in cycling science, emerged: cycling performance analysis protocols (n=8); training response and adaptations evaluation (n=8) and impact of different pedaling cadences on cycling performance (n=6). From the studies analyzing performance assessment protocols (38%), emerged how only one threshold, also named breakpoint, seems to be recognizable through NIRS during cycling tests.  Studies that focused on training metabolic adaptations (38%) and cadence analysis (25.6%) evidenced how NIRS device may represent a valid tool to analyze cyclists' metabolic adaptations and optimize pedaling cadence strategy.  Conclusionː Despite the wide range of applications and promising data emerging from NIRS studies, further investigations evaluating cycling performance are needed to better delineate possible, laboratory and field, applications, and methodologies.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to validate the accuracy of a new type of portable gas-analysis system (Sensormedics VmaxST) for the measurement of oxygen-uptake at expenditure levels that are reached during walking in patients with movement disorders. The criterion method was the Douglas Bag (DB) method, which is considered to be the gold standard. Accuracy evaluations were made in two trials, randomly using the VmaxST (ST) and the Douglas Bag method. Ten healthy adult subjects participated in the trials (age: 28.8 (4.3) years; body mass: 75 (13.3) kg; height: 179.3 (8.9) cm). Each trial consisted of two time periods: 5 min of resting in a comfortable chair and 5 min of cycling at an 80 W workload. During the fifth minute of each block, mean minute ventilation (VE), oxygen-uptake (VO2), and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were measured or calculated for both systems. Energy expenditure (EE) values were calculated and net values calculated by subtracting resting measurements from gross measurements. The results show that no significant differences were found between the VmaxST and the Douglas Bag method for the primary parameters: EEnet and VO2net. Significantly higher values were found for rest and exercise values. However, these differences were very small. Therefore, the validity of the VmaxST is sufficient for use in gait studies to determine the energy cost of walking, especially when net values are calculated. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {There is currently no universally recommended and accepted method of data processing within the science of indirect calorimetry for either mixing chamber or breath-by-breath systems of expired gas analysis. Exercise physiologists were first surveyed to determine methods used to process oxygen consumption (VO 2) data, and current attitudes to data processing within the science of indirect calorimetry. Breath-by-breath datasets obtained from indirect calorimetry during incremental exercise were then used to demonstrate the consequences of commonly used time, breath and digital filter post-acquisition data processing strategies. Assessment of the variability in breath-by-breath data was determined using multiple regression based on the independent variables ventilation (VE), and the expired gas fractions for oxygen and carbon dioxide, FEO2 and FECO2, respectively. Based on the results of explanation of variance of the breath-by-breath VO2 data, methods of processing to remove variability were proposed for time-averaged, breath-averaged and digital filter applications. Among exercise physiologists, the strategy used to remove the variability in sequential O2 measurements varied widely, and consisted of time averages (30 sec 38, 60 sec 18, 20 sec 11, 15 sec 8), a moving average of five to 11 breaths (10), and the middle five of seven breaths (7). Most respondents indicated that they used multiple criteria to establish maximum VO2 (VO2max) including: the attainment of age-predicted maximum heart rate (HRmax) 53, respiratory exchange ratio (RER) >1.10 (49) or RER >1.15 (27) and a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of >17, 18 or 19 (20). The reasons stated for these strategies included their own beliefs (32), what they were taught (26), what they read in research articles (22), tradition (13) and the influence of their colleagues (7). The combination of VE, FEO2 and FECO2 removed 96-98 of VO2 breath-by-breath variability in incremental and steady-state exercise O2 data sets, respectively. Correction of residual error in VO 2 datasets to 10 of the raw variability results from application of a 30-second time average, 15-breath running average, or a 0.04Hz low cut-off digital filter. Thus, we recommend that once these data processing strategies are used, the peak or maximal value becomes the highest processed datapoint. Exercise physiologists need to agree on, and continually refine through empirical research, a consistent process for analysing data from indirect calorimetry. {\textcopyright} 2010 Adis Data Information BV.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this review is to describe the evolution of portable open-circuit spirometry systems, and discuss their validity, reliability, and principles of operation. METHODS: Eleven devices were selected for review: the Oxylog, Aerosport KB1-C, Cosmed K2, Cosmed K4RQ, Cosmed K4b2, MetaMax I, MetaMax II, Metamax3B/VmaxST, Medgraphics VO2000, Oxycon Mobile I and Oxycon Mobile II. The validity (compared to the Douglas bag method [DBM]) and reliability of each device for measuring VO2 was summarized. RESULTS: Mean differences in resting measurements of VO2 were within ±0.05 L/min for all devices except one (difference of 0.17 L/min). When compared to the DBM, VO2 differences for all devices ranged from 0.01 L/min to 0.29 L/min during submaximal intensity exercise and from 0.01 L/min to 0.36 L/min during vigorous/maximal intensity. During submaximal and maximal intensities, ICC ranged from 0.66-0.99 and CV ranged from 2.0-14.2%. Of these devices, four used breath-by-breath technology and six used micro-proportional sampling technology. Validity and reliability of devices did not seem to differ between methods of gas collection. CONCLUSIONS: Of the three commercially available devices in 2015, all were found to be reliable. Two of the three systems (Cosmed K4b2 and Oxycon Mobile II) provided valid estimates of VO2 (mean values within ±0.10 L/min of DBM) during rest, and submaximal and maximal intensities, while the MetaMax3B slightly overestimated VO2, particularly at maximal exercise.},

Tereby, main application of lactate measurements is the endurance performance diagnostics and sports medicine training control of athletes or patients, while sometimes accompanied by spiroer-gometry. Less often in sports medicine, clinical diagnosis of metabolic myopathies by measuring blood lactate concentration is applied. For a successful implementation of the method, potential artifact sources such as faulty or non-standardized blood-sampling conditions must be ruled out.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to propose an optimization procedure for determining power output during very brief maximal pedalling exercise. Twenty-six healthy male students (21-28 years) performed anaerobic tests on a Monark bicycle ergometer with maximal effort for less than 10 s at eight different loads ranging from 28.1 to 84.2 Nm in pedalling moment. The maximal pedalling rate was determined from the minimal time required for one rotation of the cycle wheel. Pedalling rate decreased linearly with the load. The relationship between load and pedalling rate was represented by two linear regression equations for each subject; one regression equation was determined from eight pairs of pedalling rates and loads (r –0.976) and the other from three pairs (at 28.1,46.8,65.5 Nm;r –0.969). The two regression coefficients of the respective regression equations were almost identical. Mean±s.D. of maximal power output (PmM) which was determined for each subject based on the two linear regression equations for eight pairs and three pairs of pedalling rates and loads was 930±187 W (13.4±1.6 W kgBW-1) and 927±187 W (13.4±1.6 W kgBW-1), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the values of Pmax which were obtained from each equation. It was concluded that maximal anaerobic power could be simply determined by performing maximal cycling exercise at three different loads. {\textcopyright} 1985 E. & F.N. Spon Ltd.},

Thus, this study analyzed t(lim) at the power output eliciting the RCP (t(lim) at RCP), the oxygen uptake (VO(2)) response to this effort, and the influence of endurance fitness. Sixty male recreational cyclists (peak oxygen uptake [VO(2peak)] 40-60 mL∙kg∙min(-1)) performed an incremental test to determine the RCP, VO(2peak), and maximal aerobic power (MAP). They also performed constant-load tests to determine the t(lim) at RCP and t(lim) at MAP. Participants were divided based on their VO(2peak) into a low-performance group (LP, n = 30) and a high-performance group (HP, n = 30). The t(lim) at RCP averaged 20 min 32 s ± 5 min 42 s, with a high between-subject variability (coefficient of variation 28%) but with no differences between groups (p = 0.788, effect size = 0.06). No consistent relationships were found between the t(lim) at RCP and the different fitness markers analyzed (RCP, power output (PO) at RCP, VO(2peak), MAP, or t(lim) at MAP; all p > 0.05). VO(2) remained steady overall during the t(lim) test, although a VO(2) slow component (i.e., an increase in VO(2) >200 mL{\textperiodcentered}min(-1) from the third min to the end of the tests) was present in 33% and 40% of the participants in HP and LP, respectively. In summary, the PO at RCP could be maintained for about 20 min. However, there was a high between-subject variability in both the t(lim) and in the VO(2) response to this effort that seemed to be independent of fitness level, which raises concerns on the suitability of this test for fitness assessment.},

The estimated T(lim) values for each subject at GET, PWC(RPE), and RCP were determined from power curve analyses (T(lim) = ax(b)). The results indicated that the PWC(RPE) (176 ± 55 W) was not significantly different from RCP (181 ± 54 W); however, GET (155 ± 42 W) was significantly less than PWC(RPE) and RCP. The estimated T(lim) for the GET (26.1 ± 9.8 min) was significantly greater than PWC(RPE) (14.6 ± 5.6 min) and RCP (11.2 ± 3.1 min). The PWC(RPE) occurred at a mean power output that was 13.5% greater than the GET and, therefore, it is likely that the perception of effort is not driven by the same mechanism that underlies the GET (i.e., lactate buffering). Furthermore, the PWC(RPE) and RCP were not significantly different and, therefore, these thresholds may be associated with the same mechanisms of fatigue, such as increased levels of interstitial and (or) arterial [K⁺].},

abstract = {The time to exhaustion (t(lim)) at the respiratory compensation point (RCP) and whether a physiological steady state is observed at this workload remains unknown. Thus, this study analyzed t(lim) at the power output eliciting the RCP (t(lim) at RCP), the oxygen uptake (VO(2)) response to this effort, and the influence of endurance fitness. Sixty male recreational cyclists (peak oxygen uptake [VO(2peak)] 40-60 mL∙kg∙min(-1)) performed an incremental test to determine the RCP, VO(2peak), and maximal aerobic power (MAP). They also performed constant-load tests to determine the t(lim) at RCP and t(lim) at MAP. Participants were divided based on their VO(2peak) into a low-performance group (LP, n = 30) and a high-performance group (HP, n = 30). The t(lim) at RCP averaged 20 min 32 s ± 5 min 42 s, with a high between-subject variability (coefficient of variation 28%) but with no differences between groups (p = 0.788, effect size = 0.06). No consistent relationships were found between the t(lim) at RCP and the different fitness markers analyzed (RCP, power output (PO) at RCP, VO(2peak), MAP, or t(lim) at MAP; all p > 0.05). VO(2) remained steady overall during the t(lim) test, although a VO(2) slow component (i.e., an increase in VO(2) >200 mL{\textperiodcentered}min(-1) from the third min to the end of the tests) was present in 33% and 40% of the participants in HP and LP, respectively. In summary, the PO at RCP could be maintained for about 20 min. However, there was a high between-subject variability in both the t(lim) and in the VO(2) response to this effort that seemed to be independent of fitness level, which raises concerns on the suitability of this test for fitness assessment.},

abstract = {A cycle ergometer was modified to measure power (P) with resistance provided  solely by the moment of inertia (I) of the flywheel. P was calculated as the product of I, angular velocity (omega), and angular acceleration (alpha). Flywheel omega and alpha were determined by means of an optical sensor and a micro-controller based computer interface which measured time (+/- 1 microsecond) and allowed P to be calculated instantaneously (PI) every 3 degrees of pedal crank rotation or averaged over one complete revolution of the pedal cranks (PREV). Values for maximum P were identified from each bout (PI max and PREV max). Mechanical calibration of torque via a resistive strap proved this method to be both valid and accurate. Thirteen active male subjects performed four bouts of maximal acceleration lasting approximately 3-4 s with 2 min resting recovery. The mean coefficient of variation for PREV max was 3.3 +/- 0.6% and the intraclass correlation was 0.99. PREV max averaged 1317 +/- 66 W at 122 +/- 2 rpm, and PI max averaged 2137 +/- 101 W at 131 +/- 2 rpm. PREV max and PI max were highly correlated (r = 0.86 and r = 0.80 respectively, P < 0.002) with estimated lean thigh volume. Therefore, the inertial-load method provides a valid and reliable determination of cycling power in one short exercise bout.},

abstract = {The aims of the present study were both to describe anthropometrics and cycling power-velocity characteristics in top-level track sprinters, and to test the hypothesis that these variables would represent interesting predictors of the 200 m track sprint cycling performance. Twelve elite cyclists volunteered to perform a torque-velocity test on a calibrated cycle ergometer, after the measurement of their lean leg volume (LLV) and frontal surface area (A p), in order to draw torque- and power-velocity relationships, and to evaluate the maximal power (Pmax), and both the optimal pedalling rate (fopt) and torque (Topt) at which Pmax is reached. The 200 m performances - i.e. velocity (V200) and pedalling rate (f200) - were measured during international events (REC) and in the 2002 French Track Cycling Championships (NAT). Pmax, f opt, and Topt were respectively 1600 ± 116 W, 129.8 ± 4.7 rpm and 118.5 ± 9.8 N {\textperiodcentered} m. Pmax was strongly correlated with Topt (p < 0.001), which was correlated with LLV (p < 0.01). V200 was related to Pmax normalized by Ap (p ≤ 0.05) and also to fopt (p < 0.01) for REC and NAT. f200 (155.2 ± 3, REC; 149 ± 4.3, NAT) were significantly higher than fopt (p < 0.001). These findings demonstrated that, in this population of world-class track cyclists, the optimization of the ratio between Pmax and Ap represents a key factor of 200 m performance. Concerning the major role also played by fopt, it is assumed that, considering high values of f 200, sprinters with a high value of optimal pedalling rate (i.e. lower f200-fopt difference) could be theoretically in better conditions to maximize their power output during the race and hence performance. {\textcopyright} Georg Thieme Verlag KG.},

abstract = {Maximal muscular power production is of fundamental importance to human functional capacity and feats of performance. Here, we present a synthesis of literature pertaining to physiological systems that limit maximal muscular power during cyclic actions characteristic of locomotor behaviours, and how they adapt to training. Maximal, cyclic muscular power is known to be the main determinant of sprint cycling performance, and therefore we present this synthesis in the context of sprint cycling. Cyclical power is interactively constrained by force-velocity properties (i.e. maximum force and maximum shortening velocity), activation-relaxation kinetics and muscle coordination across the continuum of cycle frequencies, with the relative influence of each factor being frequency dependent. Muscle cross-sectional area and fibre composition appear to be the most prominent properties influencing maximal muscular power and the power-frequency relationship. Due to the role of muscle fibre composition in determining maximum shortening velocity and activation-relaxation kinetics, it remains unclear how improvable these properties are with training. Increases in maximal muscular power may therefore arise primarily from improvements in maximum force production and neuromuscular coordination via appropriate training. Because maximal efforts may need to be sustained for $\sim$15-60 s within sprint cycling competition, the ability to attenuate fatigue-related power loss is also critical to performance. Within this context, the fatigued state is characterised by impairments in force-velocity properties and activation-relaxation kinetics. A suppression and leftward shift of the power-frequency relationship is subsequently observed. It is not clear if rates of power loss can be improved with training, even in the presence adaptations associated with fatigue-resistance. Increasing maximum power may be most efficacious for improving sustained power during brief maximal efforts, although the inclusion of sprint interval training likely remains beneficial. Therefore, evidence from sprint cycling indicates that brief maximal muscular power production under cyclical conditions can be readily improved via appropriate training, with direct implications for sprint cycling as well as other athletic and health-related pursuits.},

abstract = {In track cycling sprint events, optimal cadence PRopt is a dynamic aspect of fatigue. It is currently unclear what cadence is optimal for an athlete's performance in sprint races and how it can be calculated. We examined fatigue-induced changes in optimal cadence during a maximal sprint using a mathematical approach. Nine elite track cyclists completed a 6-s high-frequency pedaling test and a 60-s isokinetic all-out sprint on a bicycle ergometer with continuous monitoring of crank force and cadence. Fatigue-free force-velocity (F/v) and power-velocity (P/v) profiles were derived from both tests. The development of fatigue during the 60-s sprint was assessed by fixing the slope of the fatigue-free F/v profile. Fatigue-induced alterations in PRopt were determined by non-linear regression analysis using a mono-exponential equation at constant slope. The study revealed that PRopt at any instant during a 60-s maximal sprint can be estimated accurately using a mono-exponential equation. In an isokinetic mode, a mean PRopt can be identified that enables the athlete to generate the highest mean power output over the course of the effort. Adding the time domain to the fatigue-free F/v and P/v profiles allows time-dependent cycling power to be modelled independent of cadence.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Maximal cycling exercise has been widely used to describe the power-velocity characteristics of lower-limb extensor muscles. This study investigated the contribution of each functional sector (i.e., extension, flexion, and transitions sectors) on the total force produced over a complete pedaling cycle. We also examined the ratio of effective force to the total pedal force, termed index of mechanical effectiveness (IE), in explaining differences in power between subjects. METHODS: Two-dimensional pedal forces and crank angles were measured during a cycling force-velocity test performed by 14 active men. Mean values of forces, power output, and IE over four functional angular sectors were assessed: top = 330°-30°, downstroke = 30°-150°, bottom = 150°-210°, and upstroke = 210°-330°. RESULTS: Linear and quadratic force-velocity and power-velocity relationships were obtained for downstroke and upstroke. Maximal power output (Pmax) generated over these two sectors represented, respectively, 73.6% ± 2.6% and 10.3% ± 1.8% of Pmax assessed over the entire cycle. In the whole group, Pmax over the complete cycle was significantly related to Pmax during the downstroke and upstroke. IE significantly decreased with pedaling rate, especially in bottom and upstroke. There were significant relationships between power output and IE for top and upstroke when the pedaling rate was below or around the optimal value and in all the sectors at very high cadences. CONCLUSIONS: Although data from force-velocity test primarily characterize the muscular function involved in the downstroke phase, they also reflect the flexor muscles' ability to actively pull on the pedal during the upstroke. IE influences the power output in the upstroke phase and near the top dead center, and IE accounts for differences in power between subjects at high pedaling rates. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

When the results were related to kgQ or kgQ2/3 the correlation coefficients increased with velocity (0.22 < r < 0.69) and were significant (0.05 < P < 0.001) except at 0 rad.s-1. Nevertheless, the interest of the determination of F0 in addition to Pmax is questionable because similar coefficients of correlation were obtained between Pmax and strength performances.},

abstract = {Discover what exercise testing can reveal about cardiopulmonary, vascular, and muscular health. Now in its Fifth Edition, Principles of Exercise Testing and Interpretation continues to deliver timely information on the physiology and pathophysiology of exercise and their relevance to clinical medicine. The text begins by explaining the processes by which cells receive oxygen and dispose of carbon dioxide produced as a byproduct of exercise and metabolism. By measuring gas exchange, we can better evaluate cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary functioning, as well as cellular respiration. Detailed discussions explore various types of exercise intolerance, their effects on test results, and clinical diagnoses. Using real-world cases, the text illustrates how cardiopulmonary exercise testing can evaluate the functional competency of each component in the coupling of cellular to external respiration, including the cardiovascular system. Expert authors' comments, analysis, and conclusions for each case, help to improve readers' interpretive and diagnostic skills. This in-depth resource provides Updated content and new graphics present the most current information in a reader-friendly format. Updated flow charts detail clinical presentations and differential diagnosis More than 80 case presentations improve diagnostic accuracy. Normal test values for a wide range of patient groups provide a basis for comparison and help to identify abnormalities.

abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to assess the acute effects of small changes in crank length (assumable by competitive cyclists) on metabolic cost and pedalling technique during submaximal cycling. Twelve amateur road cyclists performed three sets of submaximal pedalling (150, 200 and 250 W) at a constant cadence (91.3 ± 0.8 rpm) in a randomised order with three commonly used crank lengths, preferred (172.5–175 mm), +5 mm and −5 mm. Energy cost of pedalling, kinetic and kinematic variables were simultaneously registered. Changes in crank length had no significant effect on heart rate (144 ± 13, 145 ± 12 and 145 ± 13 bpm, respectively) and gross efficiency (GE) (20.4 ± 2.1, 20.1 ± 2.2 and 20.3 ± 2.4%, respectively). A longer crank induced a significant (P < 0.05) reduction of positive impulse proportion (PIP) (0.9–1.9%) due to a greater maximum (1.0–2.3 N {\textperiodcentered} m) and minimum torque (1.0–2.2 N {\textperiodcentered} m). At the same time, the maximum flexion and range of motion of the hip and knee joints were significantly increased (1.8–3.4° and P < 0.05), whereas the ankle joint was not affected. In conclusion, the biomechanical changes due to a longer crank did not alter the metabolic cost of pedalling, although they could have long-term adverse effects. Therefore, in case of doubt between two lengths, the shorter one might be recommended.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the influence of cadence, cycling experience, and aerobic power on delta efficiency during cycling and to determine the significance of delta efficiency as a factor underlying the selection of preferred cadence. METHODS: Delta efficiency (DE) was determined for 11 trained experienced cyclists (C), 10 trained runners (R), and 10 less-trained noncyclists (LT) at 50, 65, 80, 95, and 110 rpm. Preferred cadence (PC) was determined at 100, 150, and 200 W for C and R and at 75, 100, and 150 W for LT. Gas exchange at each power output (PO) was measured on a separate day, and the five cadences were randomly ordered on each occasion. It was hypothesized that: a) cyclists are most efficient at the higher cadences at which they are accustomed to training and racing, i.e., there will be a trend for DE to increase with increases in cadence; b) cyclists and runners will exhibit similar DE across the range of cadences tested; and c) DE of less-trained subjects will be lower than that of cyclists and runners. RESULTS: PCs of C and R were similar and did not change appreciably with PO (100 W:C, 95.6 +/- 10.8; R, 92.0 +/- 8.5: 150 W:C, 94.4 +/- 10.3; R, 92.9 +/- 7.8: 200 W:C, 92.2 +/- 7.2; R, 91.8 +/- 7.9 rpm). The PC of LT was significantly lower and decreased with increases in power output (75 W: 80.0 +/- 15.3; 100 W; 77.5 +/- 15.1; 150 W; 69.1 +/- 11.9 rpm). The first hypothesis was rejected because analysis of the cyclists' data alone revealed no systematic increase in DE as cadence was increased [F(4,40) = 0.272, P = 0.894]. Repeated measures ANOVA on all three groups revealed no group x cadence interaction [F(8,112) = 0.589, P = 0.785]. Again there was no systematic effect of cadence on DE [F(4,112) = 1.058, P = 0.381]. The second and third hypotheses were also rejected since there was no group main effect, i.e., DE of cyclists, runners, and less-trained subjects were not significantly different [F(2,28) = 1.397, P = 0.264]. CONCLUSION: Pedaling cadence did not have a dramatic effect on DE in any group. Muscular efficiency, as measured indirectly by delta efficiency, appears to remain relatively constant at approximately 24%, regardless of cycling experience or fitness level.},

abstract = {This study was undertaken to examine the effect of different pedalling cadences upon various physiological responses during endurance cycling exercise. Eight well-trained triathletes cycled three times for 30 min each at an intensity corresponding to 80% of their maximal aerobic power output. The first test was performed at a freely chosen cadence (FCC); two others at FCC-20% and FCC + 20%, which corresponded approximately to the range of cadences habitually used by road racing cyclists. The mean (SD) FCC, FCC-20% and FCC + 20% were equal to 86 (4), 69 (3) and 103 (5) rpm respectively. Heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake (VO2), minute ventilation (VE) and respiratory exchange ratio (R) were analysed during three periods: between the 4th and 5th, 14th and 15th, and 29th and 30th min. A significant effect of time (P<0.01) was found at the three cadences for HR, VO2. The VE and R were significantly (P<0.05) greater at FCC + 20% compared to FCC-20% at the 5th and 15th min but not at the 30th min. Nevertheless, no significant effect of cadence was observed in HR and VO2. These results suggest that, during high intensity exercise such as that encountered during a time-trial race, well-trained triathletes can easily adapt to the changes in cadence allowed by the classical gear ratios used in practice. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2001.},

abstract = {The metabolic cost of producing submaximal cycling power has been reported to vary with pedaling rate. Pedaling rate, however, governs two physiological phenomena known to influence metabolic cost and efficiency: muscle shortening velocity and the frequency of muscle activation and relaxation. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative influence of those two phenomena on metabolic cost during submaximal cycling. Nine trained male cyclists performed submaximal cycling at power outputs intended to elicit 30, 60, and 90% of their individual lactate threshold at four pedaling rates (40, 60, 80, 100 rpm) with three different crank lengths (145, 170, and 195 mm). The combination of four pedaling rates and three crank lengths produced 12 pedal speeds ranging from 0.61 to 2.04 m/s. Metabolic cost was determined by indirect calorimetery, and power output and pedaling rate were recorded. A stepwise multiple linear regression procedure selected mechanical power output, pedal speed, and pedal speed squared as the main determinants of metabolic cost (R2 = 0.99 ± 0.01). Neither pedaling rate nor crank length significantly contributed to the regression model. The cost of unloaded cycling and delta efficiency were 150 metabolic watts and 24.7%, respectively, when data from all crank lengths and pedal speeds were included in a regression. Those values increased with increasing pedal speed and ranged from a low of 73 ± 7 metabolic watts and 22.1 ± 0.3% (145-mm cranks, 40 rpm) to a high of 297 ± 23 metabolic watts and 26.6 ± 0.7% (195-mm cranks, 100 rpm). These results suggest that mechanical power output and pedal speed, a marker for muscle shortening velocity, are the main determinants of metabolic cost during submaximal cycling, whereas pedaling rate (i.e., activation-relaxation rate) does not significantly contribute to metabolic cost.},

Repeated measures ANOVA on all three groups revealed no group x cadence interaction [F(8,112) = 0.589, P = 0.785]. Again there was no systematic effect of cadence on DE [F(4,112) = 1.058, P = 0.381]. The second and third hypotheses were also rejected since there was no group main effect, i.e., DE of cyclists, runners, and less-trained subjects were not significantly different [F(2,28) = 1.397, P = 0.264]. CONCLUSION: Pedaling cadence did not have a dramatic effect on DE in any group. Muscular efficiency, as measured indirectly by delta efficiency, appears to remain relatively constant at approximately 24%, regardless of cycling experience or fitness level.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of pedalling rate and power output in cycling on the neuromuscular activity of the knee extensor muscles. Ten subjects took part in 15 randomised trials, which consisted of three levels of power outputs (60%, 80% and 100% maximal aerobic power) and five cadences (70%, 85%, 100%, 115% and 130% of the freely chosen cadence, FCC). Root mean square (rms) was utilized to quantify electromyographic activity of the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM) and rectus femoris (RF) muscles. The mean (SD) FCC did not change with power output, ranging from 85.0 (11.9) to 88.0 (11.1) rpm. A significant power effect (P < 0.01) for the rms of VL, VM and RF muscles was observed. Results showed no significant cadence effect on neuromuscular activity of the VL and VM muscles, while the rms of the RF muscle was significantly greater (P < 0.05) at 70% FCC when compared to other cadences. In conclusion, the neuromuscular activity of the knee extensor muscles was not significantly influenced by cadence manipulations. Thus, minimisation of the neuromuscular activity of these muscles would not seem to lead to the choice of a cadence in cycling.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study investigated the effect of prior prolonged cycling exercise performed at different cadences on subsequent neuromuscular characteristics. Methods: Eight well-trained triathletes sustained 80% of their maximal aerobic power during 30 min at three cadences: the freely chosen cadence (FCC), FCC-20% and FCC+20%. Maximal isometric and concentric (120°.s-1 and 240°.s-1 torques were recorded before and after the exercise. Central activation, neural (M-wave), and contractile (isometric muscular twitch) parameters of quadriceps muscle were also analyzed by electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve. Results: Reductions in maximal isometric (P < 0.01) and concentric torques at 120°.s-1 (P < 0.05) were found after exercise. Central activation levels fell significantly (P < 0.05) by 13-16% depending on the pedaling rate. Although the M-wave did not significantly change after exercise, the ratio EMG RMS/M-wave amplitude decreased significantly (P < 0.01) on both vastus lateralis and vastus medialis muscles for FCC-20% and FCC but not for FCC+20%. Significant decreases in maximal twitch tension (P < 0.01), maximal rate of twitch development (P < 0.01), and time to half relaxation (P < 0.01) were observed postexercise with no effect of cadence. Conclusions: These findings' suggest that force reduction after prolonged cycling is attributable to both central and peripheral factors but is not influenced by the pedaling rate in a range of FCC ± 20%.},

abstract = {Increased fat oxidation during the recovery period from exercise is thought to be  a contributing factor for excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). In an attempt to study the effect of serum free fatty acid (FFA) availability during exercise and recovery on the EPOC, nicotinic acid, a potent inhibitor of FFA mobilization from adipose tissue, was administered to five trained male cyclists prior to, during, and after a bout of cycling at 65% VO2max. In the nicotinic acid trial, a 500 mg dose of nicotinic acid was ingested prior to exercise, and 100 mg doses were ingested at 15, 30, and 45 min exercise, and 30 min recovery. The cyclists also completed a trial under control conditions. Serum FFA, serum glycerol, RER and VO2 were monitored during rest, exercise, and recovery, each of which was 1-h in duration. Nicotinic acid ingestion prevented the increase in serum FFA that occurred during exercise in the control trial. FFA levels during the nicotinic acid trial were significantly lower than control values during both exercise and recovery. Serum glycerol levels were also significantly lower during exercise in the nicotinic acid trial, indicative of a reduction in lipolysis. RER was not significantly different at rest or during exercise; however, RER values were significantly lower during recovery in the control trial, indicative of greater fat oxidation. For both treatments, postexercise VO2 remained elevated above resting levels at the completion of the 1-h recovery period. However, the magnitude of EPOC was significantly reduced after FFA blockade with nicotinic acid (3.4 +/- 0.61 vs 5.5 +/- 0.71). These results support the hypothesis that increased FFA metabolism during exercise and recovery is an important contributing factor to the magnitude of EPOC.},

abstract = {Increased fat oxidation during the recovery period from exercise is thought to be a contributing factor for excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). In an attempt to study the effect of serum free fatty acid (FFA) availability during exercise and recovery on the EPOC, nicotinic acid, a potent inhibitor of FFA mobilization from adipose tissue, was administered to five trained male cyclists prior to, during, and after a bout of cycling at 65% VO2max. In the nicotinic acid trial, a 500 mg dose of nicotinic acid was ingested prior to exercise, and 100 mg doses were ingested at 15, 30, and 45 min exercise, and 30 min recovery. The cyclists also completed a trial under control conditions. Serum FFA, serum glycerol, RER and VO2 were monitored during rest, exercise, and recovery, each of which was 1-h in duration. Nicotinic acid ingestion prevented the increase in serum FFA that occurred during exercise in the control trial. FFA levels during the nicotinic acid trial were significantly lower than control values during both exercise and recovery.

abstract = {It is speculated that anaerobic metabolism is the predominant source of energy in karate kumite. However, no experimental proof is currently available. The metabolic cost and fractions of aerobic and anaerobic energy of karate kumite fighting were investigated. Ten male nationally or internationally ranked karateka [means (SD) age 26.9 (3.8) years, height 1.80 (0.08) m, mass 77.2 (12.8) kg] performed two to four fights scheduled and judged like a championship. Oxygen uptake was measured continuously with a portable spirometric device. Blood lactate was determined immediately before, and minute by minute after, each fight. Aerobic, anaerobic alactic and anaerobic lactic energy were calculated from oxygen uptake during the fight ( VO(2)), the fast component of the post-fight oxygen uptake ( VO(2PCr)) above resting values and changes in blood lactate concentration (Net-BLC), respectively. Altogether, 36 fights lasting 267 (61) s were analysed. The referee's decisions caused an activity-to-break ratio of approximately 2:1. VO(2), VO(2PCr), and Net-BLC per fight were 165.3 (52.4) ml(.)kg(-1), 32.2 (7.2) ml(.)kg(-1)and 4.2 (1.9) mmol(.)l(-1); the overall energy cost above rest was 334.3 (86.3) kJ per fight. Fractions of aerobic, anaerobic alactic, and lactic energy sources were 77.8 (5.8)%, 16.0 (4.6)%, and 6.2 (2.4)%, respectively. The results indicate a high metabolic rate in karate kumite. However, the acyclic activity profile implies that aerobic metabolism is the predominant source of energy and there is anaerobic supplementation, mainly by high-energy phosphates.},

abstract = {Energy expenditure during bicycling on flat terrain depends predominantly on air  resistance, which is a function of total frontal area (bicycle and rider), coefficient of drag, and air speed. Body position on the bicycle may affect energy expenditure by altering either frontal area or coefficient of drag. In this study, oxygen uptake (VO2) was measured for each of four body positions in 10 cyclists (8 males, 2 females, 24 +/- 2 yr, 67.7 +/- 3.3 kg, VO2max = 65.8 +/- 1.5 ml.kg-1.min-1) while each bicycled up a 4% incline on a motor-driven treadmill (19.3 km.h-1), thereby eliminating air resistance. Positions studied included: 1) seated, hands on brake hoods, cadence 80 rev.min-1; 2) seated, hands on dropped bar (drops), 80 rev.min-1; 3) standing, hands on brake hoods, 60 rev.min-1; and 4) seated, hands on brake hoods, 60 rev.min-1. Subjects rode their own bicycles, which were equipped with a common set of racing wheels. Energy expenditure, expressed as VO2 per unit combined weight, was not significantly different between drops and hoods positioning (30.2 +/- 0.6 vs 29.9 +/- 0.9 ml.kg-1.min-1) but was significantly greater for standing compared with seated cycling (31.7 +/- 0.4 vs 28.3 +/- 0.7 ml.kg-1.min.-1, P less than 0.01). These results indicate that body posture can affect energy expenditure during uphill bicycling through factors unrelated to air resistance.},

abstract = {Despite the wide use of surface electromyography (EMG) to study pedalling movement, there is a paucity of data concerning the muscular activity during uphill cycling, notably in standing posture. The aim of this study was to investigate the muscular activity of eight lower limb muscles and four upper limb muscles across various laboratory pedalling exercises which simulated uphill cycling conditions. Ten trained cyclists rode at 80% of their maximal aerobic power on an inclined motorised treadmill (4%, 7% and 10%) with using two pedalling postures (seated and standing). Two additional rides were made in standing at 4% slope to test the effect of the change of the hand grip position (from brake levers to the drops of the handlebar), and the influence of the lateral sways of the bicycle. For this last goal, the bicycle was fixed on a stationary ergometer to prevent the lean of the bicycle side-to-side. EMG was recorded from M. gluteus maximus (GM), M. vastus medialis (VM), M. rectus femoris (RF), M. biceps femoris (BF), M. semimembranosus (SM), M. gastrocnemius medialis (GAS), M. soleus (SOL), M. tibialis anterior (TA), M. biceps brachii (BB), M. triceps brachii (TB), M. rectus abdominis (RA) and M. erector spinae (ES). Unlike the slope, the change of pedalling posture in uphill cycling had a significant effect on the EMG activity, except for the three muscles crossing the ankle's joint (GAS, SOL and TA). Intensity and duration of GM, VM, RF, BF, BB, TA, RA and ES activity were greater in standing while SM activity showed a slight decrease. In standing, global activity of upper limb was higher when the hand grip position was changed from brake level to the drops, but lower when the lateral sways of the bicycle were constrained. These results seem to be related to (1) the increase of the peak pedal force, (2) the change of the hip and knee joint moments, (3) the need to stabilize pelvic in reference with removing the saddle support, and (4) the shift of the mass centre forward.},

It was hypothesized that the exercises performed on the field would determine higher physical (power output [PO]) and mental involvements due to different environmental conditions. METHODS: Sixteen male cyclists underwent an incremental test to exhaustion and 3 TT4s under different conditions: cycle ergometer (CE), level ground (LG), and uphill (UP). RESULTS: Correlation was observed for PO with a trivial effect size and narrow limits of agreement between MAP and CE TT4 (r = .96, P < .001). The comparison between the CE, LG, and UP tests indicates that PO was significantly higher in UP than in CE (+8.0%, P < .001) and LG (+11.0%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that PO depends on the nature of the pedaling activity. Moreover, PO under CE TT4 is a relevant predictor of MAP. It seems important to measure MAP by taking into account the cycling conditions, considering that coaches and scientists use this parameter to assess the aerobic potential of athletes and determine the exercise intensities useful for monitoring adaptation to training.},

abstract = {This study was designed to examine the influence of standing position (vs.  seated) during uphill cycling on both mechanical cost (MC) and energy cost (EC) in elite cyclists. For the study, thirteen elite cyclists (VO(2max): 71.4 ± 8.0 ml{\textperiodcentered}min(-1){\textperiodcentered}kg(-1)) performed, in a randomised order, three sets of exercises. Each set comprised 2 min of exercise, alternating every 30 s between seated and standing postures, using different slopes and intensity levels on a motorised treadmill. MC was calculated from the measurement of power output and speed, whereas EC was calculated from the measurement of oxygen consumption and speed. MC was significantly higher (+4.3%, p < 0.001) in standing position compared to seated position when all slopes and intensities were considered. However, EC was not significantly affected by the change in position. The standing position also induced a significant increase in rolling resistance power (p < 0.001), rolling resistance coefficient (p < 0.001) and lateral sways (p < 0.001). The significant increase in MC observed in standing position was due to a higher rolling resistance induced by bicycle sways and a shift forward of the centre of mass compared to seated position. This result should lead bicycle tire manufacturers to reduce the increase in rolling resistance between the two positions. Considering the relationship observed between the MC and bicycle sways, cyclists would be well advised to decrease the bicycle sways in order to reduce the MC of locomotion.},

abstract = {Cyclists regularly change from a seated to a standing position when the gradient increases during uphill cycling. The aim of this study was to analyse the physiological and biomechanical responses between seated and standing positions during distance-based uphill time trials in elite cyclists. Thirteen elite cyclists completed two testing sessions that included an incremental-specific cycling test on a cycle ergometer to determine VO2max and three distance-based uphill time trials in the field to determine physiological and biomechanical variables. The change from seated to standing position did not influence physiological variables. However, power output was increased by 12.6% in standing position when compared with seated position, whereas speed was similar between the two positions. That involved a significant increase in mechanical cost and tangential force (Ftang) on the pedal (+19% and +22.4%, respectively) and a decrease (−8%) in the pedalling cadence. Additionally, cyclists spent 22.4% of their time in the standing position during the climbing time trials. Our findings showed that cyclists alternated between seated and standing positions in order to maintain a constant speed by adjusting the balance between pedalling cadence and Ftang.},

abstract = {Competitive cyclists generally climb hills at a low cadence despite the recognized advantage in level cycling of high cadences. To test whether a high cadence is more economical than a low cadence during uphill cycling, nine experienced cyclists performed steady-state bicycling exercise on a treadmill under three randomized trials. Subjects bicycled at 11.3 km.h-1 up a 10% grade while 1) pedalling at 84 rpm in a sitting position-84 Sit, 2) pedalling at 41 rpm in a standing position-41 Stand, and 3) pedalling at 41 rpm in a sitting position-41 Sit. Heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO2), ventilation (VE), and respiratory exchange ratio were measured continuously during 5-min trials and averaged over the last 2 min. Additionally, rating of perceived exertion was recorded during the fifth minute of each trial, and blood lactate concentration was recorded immediately before and after each trial. Significantly lower values for HR, VO2 and VE were recorded during 84 Sit (164 +/- 3 bpm, 51.8 +/- 0.8 ml.min-1 x kg-1, 94 +/- 5 l.min-1) than for either the 41 Stand (171 +/- 2 bpm, 53.1 +/- 0.7 ml.min-1 x kg-1, 105 +/- 6 l.min-1) o 41 Sit (168 +/- 2 bpm, 53.1 +/- 0.8 ml.min-1 x kg-1, 101 +/- 6 l.min-1) trials. No other differences were noted between trials for any of the measured variables. We conclude that uphill cycling is more economical at a high versus a low cadence.},

abstract = {Cycling was performed to test the following two hypotheses: (1) muscular  efficiency is unrelated to pedal rate (61, 88, and 115 r.p.m.) for a group of subjects with a wide range of slow twitch (ST) fibers in spite of decreasing whole-body efficiency and (2) muscular efficiency correlates positively with % ST muscle fibers, and this correlation is more pronounced at low pedal rates than at high pedal rates. Whole-body gross efficiency decreased from 20-22% at 61 r.p.m. to 15-18% at 115 r.p.m. Mean muscular efficiency for all subjects (n=16) was approximately 26%, with delta efficiency being constant and muscular efficiency (taking internal power into account) slightly increasing with pedal rate. Muscular efficiency correlated positively (R(2)=0.25) with % ST fibers (21-97% ST in m. vastus lateralis) at 115 r.p.m. while not at 61 and 88 r.p.m. In conclusion, the decrease in whole-body gross efficiency with increasing pedal rate was not explained by a decrease in muscular efficiency, and supported increase in internal power to account for the increase in metabolic power with increasing pedal rate. Furthermore, differences between individuals in muscle fiber type composition affected muscular efficiency, which correlated positively with % ST muscle fibers during fast pedalling.},

abstract = {Technique and energy saving are two variables often considered as important for performance in cycling and related to each other. Theoretically, excellent pedalling technique should give high gross efficiency (GE). The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between pedalling technique and GE. 10 well-trained cyclists were measured for GE, force effectiveness (FE) and dead centre size (DC) at a work rate corresponding to $\sim$75% of VO(2)max during level and inclined cycling, seat adjusted forward and backward, at three different cadences around their own freely chosen cadence (FCC) on an ergometer. Within subjects, FE, DC and GE decreased as cadence increased (p < 0.001). A strong relationship between FE and GE was found, which was to great extent explained by FCC. The relationship between cadence and both FE and GE, within and between subjects, was very similar, irrespective of FCC. There was no difference between level and inclined cycling position. The seat adjustments did not affect FE, DC and GE or the relationship between them. Energy expenditure is strongly coupled to cadence, but force effectiveness, as a measure for pedalling technique, is not likely the cause of this relationship. FE, DC and GE are not affected by body orientation or seat adjustments, indicating that these parameters and the relationship between them are robust to coordinative challenges within a range of cadence, body orientation and seat position that is used in regular cycling.},

abstract = {Human muscles, limbs and supporting ventilatory, cardiovascular, and metabolic systems are well adapted for walking, and there is reasonable transfer of efficiency of movement to bicycling. Our efficiency and economy of movement of bipedal walking (≈30%) are far superior to those of apes. This overall body efficiency during walking and bicycling represents the multiplicative interaction of a phosphorylative coupling efficiency of ≈60%, and a mechanical coupling efficiency of ≈50%. These coupling efficiencies compare well with those of other species adapted for locomotion. We are capable runners, but our speed and power are inferior to carnivorous and omnivorous terrestrial mammalian quadrupeds because of biomechanical and physiological constraints. But, because of our metabolic plasticity (i.e., the ability to switch among carbohydrate (CHO)- and lipid-derived energy sources) our endurance capacity is very good by comparison to most mammals, but inferior to highly adapted species such as wolves and migratory birds. Our ancestral ability for hunting and gathering depends on strategy and capabilities in the areas of thermoregulation, and metabolic plasticity. Clearly, our competitive advantage of survival in the biosphere depends in intelligence and behavior. Today, those abilities that served early hunter-gatherers make for interesting athletic competitions due to wide variations in human phenotypes. In contemporary society, the stresses of regular physical exercise serve to minimize morbidities and mortality associated with physical inactivity, overnutrition, and aging.},

Riders are required to perform on a variety of surfaces (track, road, cross-country, mountain), terrains (level, uphill and downhill) and race situations (criterions, sprints, time trials, mass-start road races) in events ranging in duration from 10 s to 3 wk stage races covering 200 m to 4,000 km. Furthermore, professional road cyclists typically have ∼ 100 race d/yr. Because of the diversity of cycle races, there are vastly different physiological demands associated with the various events. Until recently there was little information on the demands of professional cycling during training or competition. However, with the advent of reliable, valid bicycle crank dynanometers, it is now possible to quantify real-time power output, cadence and speed during a variety of track and road cycling races. This article provides novel data on the physiological demands of professional and world-class amateur cyclists and characterises some of the physiological attributes necessary for success in cycling at the {\'{e}}lite level.},

Using cross-sectional study designs, researchers have demonstrated no significant differences in gross efficiency between trained and untrained cyclists. Reviewing this literature provides evidence to suggest that methodological inadequacies may have played a crucial role in the conclusions drawn from the majority of these studies. We present an overview of these studies and their relative shortcomings and conclude that in well-controlled and rigorously designed studies, training has a positive influence upon gross efficiency. Putative mechanisms for the increase in gross efficiency as a result of training include, muscle fibre type transformation, changes to muscle fibre shortening velocities and changes within the mitochondria. However, the specific mechanisms by which training improves gross efficiency and their impact on cycling performance remain to be determined.},

Nevertheless, an instantaneous approach is presented which is based upon the application of conventional Newtonian mechanics to a rigid segment model of the body, and does not contain assumptions regarding the exact nature of segmental interactions-such as energy transfer, etc. The application of the equation to running, cycling, speed skating, swimming and rowing is discussed and definitions of power, efficiency, and economy are presented. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

METHODS: Twelve healthy subjects (four women) pedaled on a waterproof cycle ergometer in an experimental pool that was either empty (DRY) or filled with tap water at 30.8°C ± 0.6°C (WET). Four different pedal cadences (fp) were studied (40, 50, 60, and 70 rpm) at 25, 50, 75, and 100 W. The metabolic power at steady state was measured via open circuit respirometry, and Ėint was calculated as the metabolic power extrapolated for 0 W. RESULTS: The Ėint was significantly higher in WET than in DRY at 50, 60, and 70 rpm (81 ± 31 vs 32 ± 30 W, 167 ± 35 vs 50 ± 29 W, 311 ± 51 vs 81 ± 30 W, respectively, all P < 0.0001), but not at 40 rpm (16 ± 5 vs 11 ± 17 W, P > 0.99). Ėint increased with the third power of fp both in WET and DRY (R2 = 0.49 and 0.91, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Water drag increased Ėint, although limbs unloading via the Archimedes' principle and limbs shape could be potential confounding factors. A simple formula was developed to predict the increase in mechanical power in dry conditions needed to match the rate of energy expenditure during underwater cycling: 44 fp3 - 7 W, where fp is expressed in Hertz.},

abstract = {Internal and external mechanical work, energy consumption and mechanical efficiency were studied in constant‐load ergometer bicycling at five different power outputs below, equal to, and above the aerobic (AerT) and anaerobic (AnT) thresholds. The gross, net and true efficiencies of the whole body in five male subjects were calculated. The work against the external load was defined as the external mechanical work. The internal mechanical work was calculated as the sum of the increments of kinetic and potential energy in all body segments by using methods of film analysis. Total energy consumption was measured by combining aerobic and anaerobic energy production. When the power output of the bicycle ergometer was increased from 146+15 to 283 ± 17 W, oxygen consumption increased from 2.20 ± 0.98 to 4.22 ± 0.201 min‐1 (P < 0.001), while the oxygen consumption at rest was 0.30 ± 0.03 l min‐1. The concentration of blood lactate increased from 2.2 ± 0.4 at the lowest work load to 8.6 ± 1.2 mmol 1‐1 at the highest work load (P < 0.001). The amount of external work done per revolution increased from 139 ± 20 to 277 ± 29 J (P < 0.001), while the amount of internal work per revolution remained almost constant (56 ± 12 J). The gross efficiency in the present study was 17–20%, net efficiency 18–22% and true efficiency 21–30%, respectively. The highest gross and net efficiencies were reached at the AerT. The lowest efficiencies were obtained at highest work load. Oxygen uptake and total energy consumption were significantly higher and true efficiency lower at the AnT than AerT (P < 0.01). {\textcopyright} 1987 Scandinavian Physiological Society},

The subjects also pedalled at 40, 60, 80 and 100 rpm against the same resistance, giving power outputs of 80, 120, 160 and 200 W respectively. The subjects were filmed with a cine-film camera, and pedal reaction forces were recorded from a force transducer mounted in the pedal. The muscular work for the hip, knee and ankle joint muscles was calculated using a model based upon dynamic mechanics and described elsewhere. The total work during one pedal revolution significantly increased with increased work load but did not increase with increased pedalling rate at the same braking force. The relative proportions of total positive work at the hip, knee and ankle joints were also calculated. Hip and ankle extension work proportionally decreased with increased work load. Pedalling rate did not change the relative proportion of total work at the different joints. {\textcopyright} 1988 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the muscular efficiency during cycling exercise under certain total power output (Ptot) or external power output (Pext) experimental conditions that required a large range of pedal rates from 40 to 120 rpm. Muscular efficiency estimated as a ratio of Ptot, which is sum of internal power output (Pint) and Pext, to rate of energy expenditure above a resting level was investigated in two experiments that featured different conditions on a cycle ergometer, which were carried out at the same levels of Ptot (Exp. 1) and Pext (Exp. 2). Each experiment consisted of three exercise tests with three levels of pedal rates (40, 80 and 120 rpm) lasting for 2-3 min of unloaded cycling followed by 4-5 min of loaded cycling. VO2 during unloaded cycling (∼430 ml min-1 for 40 rpm, ∼640 ml min-1 for 80 rpm, ∼1,600 ml min-1 for 120 rpm) and the Pint (∼3 W for 40 rpm, ∼ 25 W for 80 rpm, ∼ 90 W for 120 rpm) in the two experiments were markedly increased with increasing pedal rates. The highest muscular efficiency was found at 80 rpm in the two experiments, whereas a remarkable reduction (19%) in muscular efficiency obtained at 120 rpm could be attributable to greater O2 cost due to higher levels of Pint accompanying the increased pedal rates. We concluded that muscular efficiency could be affected by the differences in O2 cost and Pint during cycling under the large range of pedal rates employed in this study. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

abstract = {Based on a model consisting of three rigid links, an instantaneous power equation has been deduced for ergometer cycling which shows a causal relationship between power liberated in joint rotation on the one hand and the rate of change of segmental energy plus the power transferred to the pedal on the other. The shape and magnitude of these two types of power have been calculated by measurements of pedal force and cinematographic analysis and the results show fair agreement between them. When cycling at a mean exercise intensity of 340 W at 90 rpm, less than 28 W appears to be lost in the (necessary) changes of segmental energies. It is suggested that power liberated in the joints should be judged as the source of power in the power equation. It is, therefore, proposed that this power should be defined as external power in this and other human movement. {\textcopyright} 1990 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The 'dissection' of energy expenditure of cycling into the metabolic equivalent of the different forms of mechanical work done, inaugurated 30 years ago by di Prampero and collaborators, has been much debated in the last few decades. The mechanical internal work, particularly, which is currently associated to the movement of the lower limbs, has been approached, estimated and discussed in several different ways and there is no agreed consensus on its role in cycling. This paper, through re-processing previously published data of oxygen consumption during pedalling at different frequency, external load and limb mass, proposes a model equation and a multiple non-linear regression as the method to assess the internal work of cycling. With that tool a very consistent metabolic equivalent of the internal work is obtained. However, a software simulation of pedalling limbs showed, as suggested in the literature, that the link with the chain ring allows the system to passively revolve forever, after an initial push. This result challenges the very existence of the 'kinematic internal work' of cycling. We conclude and suggest that the 'viscous internal work', an often neglected and almost unmeasurable portion of the internal work that could be proportional to the 'kinematic' form, is responsible for the extra metabolic expenditure as measured when the pedalling frequency of cycling increases. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The present study was undertaken to examine the effect of age and pedalling frequency on metabolic internal power (MPint) and delta efficiency ($\Delta$E), defined as the ratio of the change in external work accomplished to the change in energy expended, during sub-maximal exercise on a cycle ergometer. A group of 11 children [mean age (SD)][10.6 (1.0) years] and 12 adults [23.6 (3.0) years], all cyclists, performed two incremental tests at 60 rpm and 90 rpm in a randomised order. External power (EP) was measured as the product of friction load and pedalling frequency. Oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured using the Douglas bag method and an energy equivalent of 20.6 kJ{\textperiodcentered}1O2-1 was used to convert VO2 into metabolic power (MP). Linear relationships were drawn between MP and EP (MP=aEP+b) to enable the calculation of $\Delta$E (1/a) and MPint (b). All coefficients of determination were greater than 0.97. The results showed that children and adults increased their $\Delta$E with the increase in pedalling rate [27 (6)% to 36 (5)%, P < 0.05 in children and 27 (3)% to 30 (2)%, P<0.05 in adults]. Likewise, net MPint (MPint minus basal metabolism) expressed relative to total leg volume was higher at 90 rpm compared to 60 rpm [16.5 (5.0) W≥1-1 and 4.2 (2.0) W{\textperiodcentered}1-1, P < 0.05, respectively, in children and 7.4 (3.0) W{\textperiodcentered}1-1 and 5.0 (2.5) W{\textperiodcentered}1-1, NS, respectively, in adults]. At 60 rpm, children and adults showed the same $\Delta$E and net MPint values. At 90 rpm, children showed significantly higher $\Delta$E and net MPint compared to adults. This study demonstrated that $\Delta$E and net MPint are equally influenced by increasing pedalling rate in children and adults. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that differences between children and adults at 90 rpm could be related to different anthropometric characteristics.},

Seven healthy adult males [mean age: 32 (27-36) years old] participated in this study. Arm cranking and leg pedaling exercise tests were carried out using an identical electrically controlled bicycle ergometer. The cranking/pedaling rate was set at 60 rpm. Exercise was performed under the following conditions: Bilateral leg pedaling (BLP), Unilateral leg pedaling (ULP), Bilateral arm cranking (BAC), and Unilateral arm cranking (UAC). By ramp load protocol in gradually increasing 20 W/min stages, peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) and peak heart rate (peak HR) were obtained using BLP, ULP, BAC, and UAC. The oxygen uptake and heart rate obtained using BLP, ULP, BAC, and UAC were compared under three exercise work loads (20 W, 40 W, 60 W). In comparison with ULP and UAC, the values of peak VO2 and peak HR in BLP and BAC were high, and the response to the 20 W to 60 W exercise intensities rose in tandem with work load. Differences in physiological response due to disparities in the exerted muscle mass became large and showed a rising trend, particularly in ULP and UAC. There were no significant correlations between BLP and the other types of exercise (BAC, ULP, UAC) in peak VO2 and peak HR. In conclusion, the physiological responses in bilateral and unilateral arm/leg exercise at an identical work load depend on the amount of muscle mass exerted. It is hard to estimate the aerobic work capacity (peak VO2) using BLP from the results of exercise performed with BAC, ULP, and UAC.},

The purpose of this study was therefore to test the hypothesis that the O2 cost for internal power output (Pint) exerted in exercising muscle itself would be larger than for an external power output (Pint) calculated from external load and pedal rate during cycling exercise under various conditions of Pint and Pext in a large range of pedal rates. The O2 cost ($\Delta$VO2/ $\Delta$power output) was investigated in three experiments that featured different conditions on a cycle ergometer that were carried out at the same levels of total power output (P tot; sum of Pint and Pext) (Exp. 1), P ext (Exp. 2) and load (Exp. 3). Each experiment consisted of three exercise tests with three levels of pedal rate (40 rpm for a lower pedal rate: LP; 70-80 rpm for a moderate pedal rate: MP; and 100-120 rpm for a higher pedal rate: HP) lasting for 2-3 min of unloaded cycling followed by 4-5 min of loaded cycling. Blood lactate accumulations (2.3-3.4 momo11-1) at the HP were significantly higher compared with the LP (0.6-0.9 mmo11-1) and MP (0.9-l.0 mmo11-1) except for the LP in Exp. 1. The VO2 (360-432 ml min-1 for LP, 479-644 ml min-1 for MP, 960-1602 ml min-1 for HP) during unloaded cycling in the three experiments increased exponentially with increasing pedal rates regardless of Pext=0. Moreover, the slope of the VO2-Pint (13.7 ml min-1 W-1) relation revealed a steeper inclination than that of the VO2-Pext (10.2 ml min -1 W-1) relation. We concluded that the O2 cost for Pint was larger than for Pext during the cycling exercises, indicating that the O2 cost for Ptot could be affected by the ratio of Pint to Ptot due to the levels of pedal rate.},

abstract = {Internal mechanical work during cycling, required to raise and lower the legs and change their velocities, is shown to be an important factor when interpreting physiological responses to cycle ergometer exercise. The internal work required to move the legs during concentric and eccentric cycle ergometry at different speeds and workloads was calculated from segmental energy changes determined using cinematography and directly using an eccentric ergometer. The mean internal work rates obtained at pedal frequencies of 30, 60 and 90 min-1 were 11.5, 20 and 62 W respectively. When these estimates were added to the external work rates, they increased concentric and decreased eccentric work rates. The largest differences were seen at low work rates and high pedal frequencies during which concentric work rates increased by 51% and eccentric decreased 60% by the inclusion of internal work. When comparisons of concentric and eccentric cycling at equal uncorrected work rates were made, neglecting to include internal work introduced errors ranging from 12 to 97%. The calculated estimates of internal work agreed well with the power supplied by the eccentric ergometer to move the legs passively. The investigations show that the inclusion of internal work is important when comparing physiological responses during concentric and eccentric ergometry, especially when pedal frequences exceed 60 min-1 and when work rates are small. {\textcopyright} 1986 Springer-Verlag.},

The present aim was to calculate IP from metabolic variables and to perform a physiological evaluation of five different kinematic models for calculating IP in cycling. Results showed that IP was statistically different between the kinematic models applied. IP based on metabolic variables (IPmet) was 15, 41, and 91 W at 61, 88, and 115 rpm, respectively, being remarkably close to the kinematic estimate of one model (IPWillems-COM: 14, 43, and 95 W) and reasonably close to another kinematic estimate (IPWinter: 8, 29, and 81 W). For all kinematic models there was no significant effect of performing 3-D versus 2-D analyses. IP increased significantly with pedal rate - leg movements accounting for the largest fraction. Further, external power (EP) affected IP significantly such that IP was larger at moderate than at low EP at the majority of the pedal rates applied but on average this difference was only 8%. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2003.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to calculate optimal pedaling rates based upon external work (EW) rate and mechanical work (MW) rate criteria that respectively exclude and include the internal work (IW) rate of the lower limbs. Metabolic and kinematic data were collected as 12 males pedaled an ergometer at rates of 40, 60, 80, and 98 rpm while producing external power outputs of 49, 98, and 146 W. Energy expenditure (EE) was calculated from steady rate oxygen uptake and respiratory exchange ratio values. The IW rate was determined from digitized kinematic data by modeling the thigh, shank, and foot as a three-segment linked system and calculating their changes in potential, translational kinetic, and rotational kinetic energy. The EW rate was calculated from the observed pedaling rate and the ergometer resistance. The MW rate was defined as the sum of the EW rate and IW rate. At each level of external power output, the MW rate increased linearly with pedaling rate increments while the EE displayed a curvilinear relationship. Both gross efficiency (GE = EW rate/EE) and mechanical efficiency (ME = MW rate/EE) responded quadratically to pedaling rate treatments but a repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant differences in their beta 0, beta 1, and beta 2 regression coefficients. Optimal pedaling rates calculated from ME were consistently higher (82 to 101 rpm) than those determined from GE (35 to 57 rpm). The pedaling rates that optimized ME, but not GE, are similar to the rates reported to be biomechanically optimal and preferred by trained cyclists.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the interactions between cadence and power output effects on cycling efficiency. Fourteen healthy subjects performed four constant power output-tests (40, 80, 120 and 160 W) in which the cadence varied in five bouts from 40 to 120 rpm. Gross efficiency (GE) was determined over the last ten respiratory cycles of each bout and was calculated as the ratio of mechanical energy to energy expenditure. Results showed that (1) GE-cadence relationships reached a maximum at each power output corresponding to the cadence maximising efficiency (CAeff) and (2) GE increased with power output whatever the cadence until a maximal theoretical value. Moreover, interactions were found between these two factors: the cadence effect decreased linearly with power output and the power output effect increased exponentially with cadence. Consequently, cycling efficiency decreased more when cadence differed from CAeff at low than at high power output, and increased more with power output at high cadence than at low cadence. These interactions between cadence and power output effects on GE were mainly due to cadence and power output effects on the energy expenditure shares not contributing to power production. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2006.},

Fifteen well-trained cyclists exercised for 30 minutes at 60, 80, or 100 RPM on three different occasions. On each occasion, the load was increased every five minutes and corresponded to approximately 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90% of VO2max. During the last three minutes of each stage, steady-state energy expenditure was calculated while work rate was recorded. In addition, the oxygen cost of unloaded cycling (CUC) was also measured. GE was calculated as the ratio of work rate to the rate of energy expenditure, whereas DE was calculated as the reciprocal of the slope of this relationship at work rates between 50 and 90% of VO2max. The CUC corresponded to 0.66 +/- 0.03 l/min, 0.77 +/- 0.04 l/min and 1.04 +/- 0.04 l/min at 60 RPM, 80 RPM and 100 RPM, respectively (p less than 0.01 for all comparisons). GE was similar at all cadences when cycling at 80 and 90% VO2max.

Sports Exerc., Vol. 25, No. 9, pp. 1031–1037, 1993. Oxygen uptake (V̇2) and exercise efficiency during cycle ergometer exercise are considered to be independent of body mass. To determine the validity of this assumption, 50 females ranging in body mass from 41.5–98.9 kg exercised on a cycle ergometer with no load at 60 rpm and at 25, 50, 75, and 100 W at 60 and 90 rpm. Gross V̇2 and efficiency, net V̇2 and efficiency, work V̇2 and efficiency, and delta efficiency were computed. Gross and net V̇2 were significantly and positively correlated with body mass at all work rates and pedal frequencies. Gross efficiency was significantly and negatively correlated with body mass at all work rates and pedal frequencies. Work V̇2 and body mass were not significantly correlated. The correlations between work and delta efficiency and body mass were not significant. Since body mass was found to be significantly correlated with gross V̇2, the following equation was developed using stepwise multiple regression to predict gross V̇2: V̇2 (ml{\textperiodcentered}min−1) = 10.9 (work rate, W) + 8.2 (pedal rate, rpm) + 8.3 (body mass, kg) = 559.6. These data suggest that body mass should be considered when estimating the oxygen uptake during cycle ergometer exercise. {\textcopyright}1993The American College of Sports Medicine},

abstract = {Tractional resistance (RT, N) was determined by towing two cyclists on a racing bike in "fully dropped" posture in calm air on a flat track at constant speed (5--16.5 m/s). RT increased with the air velocity (v, m/s): RT = 3.2 + 0.19 V2. The constant 3.2 N is interpreted as the rolling resistance and the term increasing with v2 as the air resistance. For a given posture this is a function of the body surface (SA, m2), the air temperature (T, degree K), and barometric pressure (PB, Torr). The mechanical power output (W, W) can then be described as a function of the air (v) and ground (s) speed: W = 4.5.10(-2) Ps + 4.1.10(-2) SA (PB/T)v2 s, where P is the overall weight in kg. With a mechanical efficiency of 0.25, the energy expenditure rate (VO2, ml/s) is given by: VO2 = 8.6.10(-3) Ps + 7.8.10(-3) SA (PB/T)v2 s (1 ml O2 = 20.9 J). As the decrease of VO2max with altitude is known from the literature, this last equation allows the calculation of the optimal altitude for top aerobic performance. The prediction derived from this equation is consistent with the present 1-h world record.},

abstract = {We measured the metabolic cost (C) and mechanical work of riding historic bicycles at different speeds: these bicycles included the Hobby Horse (1820s), the Boneshaker (1860s), the High Wheeler (1870s), the Rover (1880s), the Safety (1890s) and a modern bicycle (1980s) as a mean of comparison. The rolling resistance and air resistance of each vehicle were assessed. The mechanical internal work (W(INT)) was measured from three-dimensional motion analysis of the Hobby Horse and modern bicycle moving on a treadmill at different speeds. The equation obtained from the modern bicycle data was applied to the other vehicles. We found the following results. (i) Apart from the Rover, which was introduced for safety reasons, every newly invented bicycle improved metabolic economy. (ii) The rolling resistance decreased with subsequent designs while the frontal area and, hence, aerodynamic drag was fairly constant (except for the High Wheeler). (iii) The saddle-assisted body weight relief (which was inaugurated by the Hobby Horse) was responsible for most of the reduction in metabolic cost compared with walking or running. Further reductions in C were due to decreases in stride/pedalling frequency and, hence, W(INT) at the same speeds. (iv) The introduction of gear ratios allowed the use of pedalling frequencies that optimize the power/contraction velocity properties of the propulsive muscles. As a consequence, net mechanical efficiency (the ratio between the total mechanical work and C) was almost constant (0.273 +/- 0.015s.d.) for all bicycle designs, despite the increase in cruising speed. In the period from 1820 to 1890, improved design of bicycles increased the metabolically equivalent speed by threefold compared with walking at an average pace of ca. + 0.5 ms(-1) per decade [corrected]. The speed gain was the result of concurrent technological advancements in wheeled, human-powered vehicles and of 'smart' adaptation of the same actuator (the muscle) to different operational conditions.},

abstract = {We measured the metabolic cost (C) and mechanical work of riding historic bicycles at different speeds: these bicycles included the Hobby Horse (1820s), the Boneshaker (1860s), the High Wheeler (1870s), the Rover (1880s), the Safety (1890s) and a modern bicycle (1980s) as a mean of comparison. The rolling resistance and air resistance of each vehicle were assessed. The mechanical internal work (W(INT)) was measured from three-dimensional motion analysis of the Hobby Horse and modern bicycle moving on a treadmill at different speeds. The equation obtained from the modern bicycle data was applied to the other vehicles. We found the following results. (i) Apart from the Rover, which was introduced for safety reasons, every newly invented bicycle improved metabolic economy. (ii) The rolling resistance decreased with subsequent designs while the frontal area and, hence, aerodynamic drag was fairly constant (except for the High Wheeler). (iii) The saddle-assisted body weight relief (which was inaugurated by the Hobby Horse) was responsible for most of the reduction in metabolic cost compared with walking or running. Further reductions in C were due to decreases in stride/pedalling frequency and, hence, W(INT) at the same speeds. (iv) The introduction of gear ratios allowed the use of pedalling frequencies that optimize the power/contraction velocity properties of the propulsive muscles. As a consequence, net mechanical efficiency (the ratio between the total mechanical work and C) was almost constant (0.273 +/- 0.015s.d.) for all bicycle designs, despite the increase in cruising speed. In the period from 1820 to 1890, improved design of bicycles increased the metabolically equivalent speed by threefold compared with walking at an average pace of ca. + 0.5 ms(-1) per decade [corrected]. The speed gain was the result of concurrent technological advancements in wheeled, human-powered vehicles and of 'smart' adaptation of the same actuator (the muscle) to different operational conditions.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To optimize endurance cycling performance, it is important to maximize efficiency. Power-measuring cranks and force-sensing pedals can be used to determine the mechanical effectiveness of cycling. From both a coaching and basic science perspective, it is of interest if a mechanically effective pedaling technique leads to greater efficiency. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of different pedaling techniques on mechanical effectiveness and gross efficiency during steady-state cycling. METHODS: Eight male cyclists exercised on a cycle ergometer at 90 rpm and 200 W using four different pedaling techniques: preferred pedaling; pedaling in circles; emphasizing the pull during the upstroke; and emphasizing the push during the downstroke. Each exercise bout lasted 6 min and was interspersed with 6 min of passive rest. We obtained mechanical effectiveness and gross efficiency using pedal-reaction forces and respiratory measures, respectively. RESULTS: When the participants were instructed to pull on the pedal during the upstroke, mechanical effectiveness was greater (index of force effectiveness = 62.4 ± 9.8%) and gross efficiency was lower (gross efficiency = 19.0 ± 0.7%) compared with the other pedaling conditions (index of force effectiveness = 48.2 ± 5.1% and gross efficiency = 20.2 ± 0.6%; means and standard deviations collapsed across preferred, circling, and pushing conditions). Mechanical effectiveness and gross efficiency during the circling and pushing conditions did not differ significantly from the preferred pedaling condition. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical effectiveness is not indicative of gross efficiency across pedaling techniques. These results thereby provide coaches and athletes with useful information for interpreting measures of mechanical effectiveness. {\textcopyright}2007The American College of Sports Medicine.},

abstract = {Bicycles have been a common device to enhance physical fitness level in gyms and training centers along with solid use in competitive sport. For that reason, biomechanics of cycling has grown as a research field with many publications addressing different perspective of the interaction between the cyclist and his bicycle. The most common end point of research on biomechanics of cycling is optimization of performance and reduction of injury risk. One goal of this book is to meet the growing need for a comprehensive presentation of contemporary knowledge on biomechanics of cycling which will positively influence the activity of cycling in a global fashion. In order to accomplish this purpose, ten chapters are presented with focus on varying methods for biomechanical analysis of cycling motion. The introduction section provides an overview of the main methods for assessment of cycling motion, including motion analysis, pedal force measurements, muscle activation, anthropometry and joint kinetics. These methods are discussed in depth in individual chapters followed by chapters on characteristics of bicycles and potential perspectives to improve their configuration in order to improve performance of cyclists and reduce their overuse injury risk. Moreover, a preliminary method to train technique in cyclists is shown. A final chapter provides authors perspective on the upcoming technology that should be effective in helping training of cyclists. Introduction to Biomechanical Analysis for Performance Enhancement and Injury Prevention -- Measuring Pedal Forces -- Muscle Activity -- Joint Kinematics -- Kinetics and Pedaling Technique -- Non-traumatic Injuries in Cycling -- Bicycle Types and Sizes -- Optimizing Bicycle Configuration and Cyclists' Body Position to Prevent Overuse Injury Using Biomechanical Approaches -- Pedaling Technique Changes with Force Feedback Training in Competitive Cyclists: Preliminary Study -- Technology in Cycling.},

abstract = {Investigations were performed in trained and untrained subjects to learn why cyclists always prefer pedaling frequencies of 80-90 rpm, though it is known that the optimal efficiency for untrained subjects is found to be in a range from 50 to 60 rpm. It has been shown that trained subjects also have a range of an optimal efficiency from 50 to 60 rpm. The perception of force causes the subject to choose a pedaling frequency which is too high and therefore less efficient. The relation between force and force-perception is described by a power-function. That means that high forces will be overestimated, low forces will be underestimated by the subject. That is the reason, why subjects prefer smaller pedaling forces which they compensate by higher pedaling frequencies, although energetic efficiency and work capacity decline. {\textcopyright} 1968 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the changes determined by increased cadence on skeletal muscle oxygenation during cycling at an exercise intensity equal to the ventilatory threshold (T vent ). Nine healthy, active individuals with different levels of cycling experience exercised at a power output equal to T vent , pedaling at cadences of 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 rpm, each for 4 min. Cadences were tested in a randomized counterbalanced sequence. Cardiopulmonary and metabolic responses were studied using an ECG for heart rate, and gas calorimetry for pulmonary oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production. NIRS was used to determine the tissue saturation index (TSI), a measure of vastus lateralis oxygenation. TSI decreased from rest to exercise; the magnitude of this TSI reduction was significantly greater when pedaling at 90 rpm (-14±4%), compared to pedaling at 40 (-12±3%) and 50 (-12±3%) rpm (P=0.027 and 0.017, respectively). Albeit small, the significant decrease in $\Delta$TSI at increased cadence recorded in this study suggests that skeletal muscle oxygenation is relatively more affected by high cadence when exercise intensity is close to T vent .},

abstract = {The selection of cadence during cycling may be determined by a number of factors, including the degree of oxygenation in the exercising skeletal muscle. The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of muscle oxygenation associated with different cycling cadences and exercise intensities, and its putative role in the choice of self-selected cadence during cycling. We recorded cardiopulmonary and metabolic responses to cycling at exercise intensities of 70% and 90% of the ventilatory threshold (Tvent), and used near-infrared spectroscopy to determine tissue saturation index as a measure of skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis) oxygenation. Twelve participants cycled at cadences of 30, 50, 70, 90, and 110 revolutions per minute (rpm), each for 4 min, in a randomized sequence, interspersed with active recovery periods. Despite cardiopulmonary and metabolic responses being greater at 90% than at 70% Tvent, and at 110 rpm compared with lower cadences, vastus lateralis oxygenation was not different between the two exercise intensities and five cadences tested. Our results indicate that skeletal muscle tissue saturation index is not substantially affected during cycling for short periods of time at constant, moderate exercise intensity at cadences between 30 and 110 rpm, suggesting that skeletal muscle oxygenation may not be an important negative feedback signal in the choice of self-selected cadence during cycling at moderate exercise intensity.},

abstract = {Many studies have attempted to describe the optimal cadence in cycling. However, the effect on performance has received little attention. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine the effect of cadence on performance during prolonged cycling (∼30 min). Fourteen male elite cyclists performed two or five time trials at different cadences [60, 80, 100, 120 rpm or freely chosen cadence (FCC)]. The total work was the same between the time trials, and the subjects were instructed to complete each time trial as fast as possible by adjusting the workload with buttons mounted on the handlebar. Accumulated work and cadence was visualised on a monitor. Oxygen uptake was measured continuously and blood lactate concentration every fifth minute. Compared to 80 rpm, finishing times at 60, 100 and 120 rpm were 3.5, 1.7 and 10.2% slower (P <0.05). Finishing time at FCC (mean 90 rpm) was indistinguishable from 80 and 100 rpm. Gross efficiency at 80 rpm was 2.9, 2.3, 3.4 and 12.3% larger than at 60, FCC, 100 and 120 rpm, respectively (P <0.05). The maximal energy turnover rate was 1.7% higher at 100 than at 80 rpm (P <0.05). This could not, however, compensate for the 3.4% lower efficiency at 100 rpm. This study demonstrated that elite cyclists perform best at their most efficient cadence despite the maximal energy turnover rate being larger at a higher cadence. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {Although oxygenation levels and muscle recruitment patterns of the quadriceps femoris during an incremental cycling exercise has been reported, oxygenation and activation profiles of the quadriceps femoris in racing posture in cycle-based athletes remain unknown. This study aimed to examine the effects of riding posture on oxygenation and neuromuscular activation of quadriceps femoris during an incremental cycling exercise in cycle-based athletes. Nine cycle-based athletes and nine nonathletic subjects performed an incremental cycling exercise at a constant cadence of 90 rpm. Riding postures were the racing posture using an aero-handle bar (aero posture) and the usual upright racing posture as the control (upright posture). Near-infrared spectroscopy and surface electromyography were recorded from vastus lateralis and rectus femoris. Changes in the tissue oxygenation index of the near-infrared spectroscopy from baseline were calculated, and the amplitudes of electromyographic signals were normalized to the initial values of the exercise in each muscle. In cycle-based athletes, changes in the tissue oxygenation index of vastus lateralis and rectus femoris in the aero posture were significantly lower than those obtained in the upright posture throughout the exercise, whereas no significant differences between the postures were observed in the normalized electromyographic amplitudes of vastus lateralis and rectus femoris. A significant difference between the postures was only occurred in changes of the tissue oxygenation index of rectus femoris in the final phase of exercise in nonathletic subjects. It appears that riding posture affects the oxygenation pattern of quadriceps femoris during incremental cycling exercise in cycle-based athletes. The main results of this study suggest that aero posture during incremental cycle exercise enhanced the muscular oxygen consumption of the quadriceps femoris in the trained cyclists.},

Numerous publications on cycling document this interest. A practical focus of this research is the examination of cadence and pedaling technique from different points of view. Focusing on competition the optimal cadence and pedaling technique to gene-rate maximal power for an endurance activity are of great interest. With one question cycling research has not argued enough yet: why do professional cyclists adopt a lower cadence when they are cycling uphill compared to cycling on level ground? Currently no scientific evidence is available to explain this choice of a lower cadence. This review article shows the current research state in the field of optimal cadence and pedaling technique and lists some potential factors that could affect the optimal cadence and give an answer to the mentioned question. Conclusion: A general optimal cadence does not exist. With a holistic mechano-physiological model the variations of optimal cadence could be explained.},

The aim of this study was to analyse the physiological and biomechanical responses between seated and standing positions during distance-based uphill time trials in elite cyclists. Thirteen elite cyclists completed two testing sessions that included an incremental-specific cycling test on a cycle ergometer to determine VO2max and three distance-based uphill time trials in the field to determine physiological and biomechanical variables. The change from seated to standing position did not influence physiological variables. However, power output was increased by 12.6% in standing position when compared with seated position, whereas speed was similar between the two positions. That involved a significant increase in mechanical cost and tangential force (Ftang) on the pedal (+19% and +22.4%, respectively) and a decrease (−8%) in the pedalling cadence. Additionally, cyclists spent 22.4% of their time in the standing position during the climbing time trials. Our findings showed that cyclists alternated between seated and standing positions in order to maintain a constant speed by adjusting the balance between pedalling cadence and Ftang.},

Methods: On three separated occasions (ie, one for each position), 11 recreational male road cyclists performed a 14 seconds sprint before and directly after a high-intensity lead-up. Power output, cadence, and torque were measured during each sprint. Results: No significant differences in peak and mean power output were observed between the forward standing (1125.5 ± 48.5 W and 896.0 ± 32.7 W, respectively) and either the seated or standing positions (1042.5 ± 46.8 W and 856.5 ± 29.4 W; 1175.4 ± 44.9 W and 927.5 ± 28.9 W, respectively). Power output was higher in the standing, compared with the seated position. No difference was observed in cadence between positions. At the start of the sprint before the lead-up, peak torque was higher in the standing position vs the forward standing position; and peak torque occurred later in the pedal revolution for both the forward standing and standing positions when compared with the seated position. At the start of the sprint after the lead-up, peak torque occurred later in the forward standing position when compared with both the seated and standing position. At the end of the sprint, no difference in torque was found between the forward standing and standing position either before or after the lead-up. Conclusion: Sprinting in the forward standing sprint position does not impair power output, cadence, and torque when compared with the seated and standing sprint positions.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the preferred cycling cadence of professional riders during competition. Methods: We measured the cadence of seven professional cyclists (28 ± 1 yr) during 3-wk road races (Giro d'Italia, Tour de France, and Vuelta a Espafĩa) involving three main competition requirements: uphill cycling (high mountain passes of ∼15 km, or HM); individual time trials of ∼50 km on level ground (TT); and flat, long (∼190 km) group stages (F). Heart rate (HR) data were also recorded as an indicator of exercise intensity during HM, TT, and F. Results: Mean cadence was significantly lower (P < 0.01) during HM (71.0 ± 1.4 rpm) than either F and TT (89.3 ± 1.0 and 92.4 ± 1.3 rpm, respectively). HR was similar during HM and TT (157 ± 4 and 158 ± 3 bpm) and in both cases higher (P < 0.01) than during F (124 ± 2 bpm). Conclusion: During both F and TT, professional riders spontaneously adopt higher cadences (around 90 rpm) than those previously reported in the majority of laboratory studies as being the most economical.

abstract = {Standing during cycling may increase overall muscular activity. However, effects of standing vs. seated posture on performance measures during repeated bouts have not been extensively explored. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of standing vs. seated posture on repeated Wingate performance. Healthy volunteers (n = 35) performed 3 consecutive Wingate anaerobic power tests (W1, W2, W3) in a standing (STA) as well as seated (SIT) posture. Within-group comparisons were made for peak power, mean power, minimum power, and fatigue index. Results were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. No significant differences were found for peak power in W1, W2, or W3. No significant difference was found for mean power in W1 or W2, but significant differences were found for mean power in W3 (STA: 451.5 ± 105.3, SIT: 425.7 ± 110.0); minimum power in W1 (STA: 433.6 ± 100.8, SIT: 381.5 ± 96.9), W2 (STA: 348.1 ± 112.9, SIT: 308.0 ± 95.8), W3 (STA: 292.0 ± 103.6, SIT: 265.3 ± 90.8); and fatigue index: W1 (STA: 51.3 ± 10.7, SIT: 56.9 ± 9.3), W2 (STA: 56.5 ± 12.6, SIT: 61.8 ± 12.2), W3 (STA: 59.4 ± 13.1, SIT: 63.6 ± 12.4). Results suggest that a standing posture enhances performance during repeated Wingate cycling. The enhancement is most likely due to an attenuated loss in power, which in turn improves fatigue index.},

abstract = {Alterations in kinetic patterns of pedal force and crank torque due to changes in surface grade (level vs. 8% uphill) and postuer (seated vs. standing) were investigated during cycling on a computerized ergometer. Kinematic data from a planar cine analysis and force data from a pedal instrumented with piezoelectric crystals were recorded from multiple trials of 8 elite cyclists. These measures were used to calculate pedal force, pedal orientation, and crank torque profiles as a function of crank angle in three conditioned: seated level, seated uphill, and standing uphill. The change in surface grade from level to 8% uphill resulted in a shift in pedal angle (toe up) and a moderately higher peak crank torque, due at least in part to a reduction in the cycling cadence. However, the overall patterns of pedal and crank kinetics were similar in the two seated conditions. In contrast, the alteration in posture from sitting to standing on the hill permitted the subjects to produce different patterns of pedal and crank kinetics, characterized by significantly higher peak pedal force and crank torque that occurred much later in the downstroke. These kinetic changes were associated with modified pedal orientation (toe down) throughout the crank cycle. Further, the kinetic changes were linked to altered nonmuscular (gravitational and inertial) contributions to the applied pedal force, caused by the removal of the saddle as a base of support.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to clarify the functional roles of upper limb muscles during standing and seated cycling when power output increases. We investigated the activity of seven upper limb and trunk muscles using surface electromyography (EMG). Power outputs ranged from $\sim$100–700 W with a pedalling frequency of 90 revolution per minute. Three-dimensional handle and pedal forces were simultaneously recorded. Using non-negative matrix factorisation, we extracted muscle synergies and we analysed the integrated EMG and EMG temporal patterns. Most of the muscles showed tonic activity that became more phasic as power output increased. Three muscle synergies were identified, associated with (i) torso stabilisation, (ii) compensation/generation of trunk accelerations and (iii) upper body weight support. Synergies were similar for seated and standing positions (Pearson's r > 0.7), but synergy #2 (biceps brachii, deltoidus and brachioradialis) was shifted forward during the cycle ($\sim$7% of cycle). The activity levels of synergy #1 (latissimus dorsi and erector spinae) and synergy #2 increased markedly above $\sim$500 W (i.e., $\sim$+40–70% and +130–190%) and during periods corresponding to ipsi- and contralateral downstrokes, respectively. Our study results suggest that the upper limb and trunk muscles may play important roles in cycling when high power outputs are required.},

Prompted by gaps in research, we compared VO2 and heart rate (HR) (Study 1), muscle activation (Study 2) and breathing and pedaling entrainment (Study 3). METHODS: Subjects rode their bicycles on a treadmill in seated and standing positions. In Study 1, VO2 and HR of four male cyclists (21.3 ± 1.7 yrs; 69.1 ± 6 ml/kg/min) were collected, alternating positions every 5 minutes for 20 minutes (8 mph, 8% grade). In Study 2, muscle activations of eight male cyclists (24 ± 5 yrs, 67.6 ± 5.5 ml/kg/min) were collected on Rectus Femoris (RF), Biceps Femoris, Vastus Medialis (VM) and Gastrocnemius alternating positions every minute (8 mph, 8% grade). In Study 3, flow rate and entrainment of nine male cyclists (28 ± 7 yrs, 62.7 ± 7.7 ml/kg/min) were collected in 2-minute stages at 6, 8 and 10 mph, (8% grade) alternating positions every minute. RESULTS: VO2 and HR increased standing (3.17± 0.43 L/min, 175 ± 4 bpm) compared to seated (3.06 ± 0.37 L/min, 166 ± 5 bpm) (p < 0.05). Normalized EMG for RF and VM increased standing (47 ± 5%, 57 ± 15%) compared to seated (34 ± 3%, 36 ± 8%) (p < 0.05). Peak Inspiratory and Expiratory Flow increased standing (3.44±0.07 and 2.45±0.05 L/sec) compared to seated (3.09 ±0.06 and 2.21±0.04 L/sec) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Uphill cycling while standing results in decreased cycling economy due to physiological and biomechanical variations compared to riding seated.},

abstract = {Spontaneous changes of movement patterns may allow to elucidate which criteria influence movement pattern preferences. However, the factors explaining the sit-stand transition in cycling are unclear. This study investigated if biomechanical and/or muscle activation cost functions could predict the power at which the spontaneous sit-stand transition occurs. Twenty-five participants performed an incremental test leading to the sit-to-stand transition, and subsequent randomized pedaling trials at 20 to 120% of the transition power in seated and standing position. A Moment Cost Function based on lower limbs net joint moments and two Electromyographic Cost Functions based on EMG data were defined. All cost functions increased with increasing crank power (p < 0.001) but at different rates in the seated and standing positions. They had lower values in the seated position below the transition power and lower values in the standing position above the transition power (p < 0.05). These results suggest that spontaneous change of position observed in cycling with increasing crank power represents an optimal choice to minimize muscular efforts. These results support the use of simple cost functions to define optimal settings in cycling and to assess the cost of cycling during short-term efforts.},

It is unknown whether the cycling intensity moderates the reduction in cycling economy while standing. Purpose: The aim was to determine whether the negative effect of standing on cycling economy would be decreased at a higher intensity. Methods: Ten cyclists cycled in 8 different conditions. Each condition was either at an intensity of 50% or 70% of maximal aerobic power at a gradient of 4% or 8% and in the seated or standing cycling position. Cycling economy and muscle activation level of 8 leg muscles were recorded. Results: There was an interaction between cycling intensity and position for cycling economy (P =.03), the overall activation of the leg muscles (P =.02), and the activation of the lower leg muscles (P =.05). The interaction showed decreased cycling economy when standing compared with seated cycling, but the difference was reduced at higher intensity. The overall activation of the leg muscles and the lower leg muscles, respectively, increased and decreased, but the differences between standing and seated cycling were reduced at higher intensity. Conclusions: Cycling economy was lower during standing cycling than seated cycling, but the difference in economy diminishes when cycling intensity increases. Activation of the lower leg muscles did not explain the lower cycling economy while standing. The increased overall activation, therefore, suggests that increased activation of the upper leg muscles explains part of the lower cycling economy while standing.},

Methods Eighteen trained cyclists were tested for efficiency, index of pedal force effectiveness (IFE), distribution of power production during the pedal revolution (dead center size [DC]), and timing and level of muscle activity of eight leg muscles. Cycling was performed on a treadmill at gradients of 0% (level), 4%, and 8%, each at three different cadences (60, 75, and 90 rev{\textperiodcentered}min−1). Results Efficiency was significantly decreased at a gradient of 8% compared with both 0% and 4% (P < 0.05). The relationship between cadence and efficiency was not changed by gradient (P > 0.05). At a gradient of 8%, there was a larger IFE between 45° and 225° and larger DC, compared with 0% and 4% (P < 0.05). The onset of muscle activity for vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, gastrocnemius lateralis, and gastrocnemius medialis occurred earlier with increasing gradient (all P < 0.05), whereas none of the muscles showed a change in offset (P > 0.05). Uphill cycling increased the overall muscle activity level (P < 0.05), mainly induced by increased calf muscle activity.

abstract = {Much of the previous research into understanding fatigue during prolonged cycling has found that cycling performance may be limited by numerous physiological, biomechanical, environmental, mechanical and psychological factors. From over 2000 manuscripts addressing the topic of fatigue, a number of diverse cause-and-effect models have been developed. These include the following models: (i) cardiovascular/anaerobic; (ii) energy supply/energy depletion; (iii) neuromuscular fatigue; (iv) muscle trauma; (v) biomechanical; (vi) thermoregulatory; (vii) psychological/motivational; and (viii) central governor. More recently, however, a complex systems model of fatigue has been proposed, whereby these aforementioned linear models provide afferent feedback that is integrated by a central governor into our unconscious perception of fatigue. This review outlines the more conventional linear models of fatigue and addresses specifically how these may influence the development of fatigue during cycling. The review concludes by showing how these linear models of fatigue might be integrated into a more recently proposed nonlinear complex systems model of exercise-induced fatigue.},

abstract = {Professional road cycling is an extreme endurance sport. Approximately 30 000 to 35 000km are cycled each year in training and competition and some races, such as the Tour de France last 21 days (∼ 100 hours of competition) during which professional cyclists (PC) must cover >3500km. In some phases of such a demanding sport, on the other hand, exercise intensity is surprisingly high, since PC must complete prolonged periods of exercise (i.e. time trials, high mountain ascents) at high percentages (∼90%) of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) [above the anaerobic threshold (AT)]. Although numerous studies have analysed the physiological responses of elite, amateur level road cyclists during the last 2 decades, their findings might not be directly extrapolated to professional cycling. Several studies have recently shown that PC exhibit some remarkable physiological responses and adaptations such as: an efficient respiratory system (i.e. lack of 'tachypnoeic shift' at high exercise intensities); a considerable reliance on fat metabolism even at high power outputs; or several neuromuscular adaptations (i.e. a great resistance to fatigue of slow motor units). This article extensively reviews the different responses and adaptations (cardiopulmonary system, metabolism, neuromuscular factors or endocrine system) to this sport. A special emphasis is placed on the evaluation of performance both in the laboratory (i.e. the controversial Conconi test, distinction between climbing and time trial ability, etc.) and during actual competitions such as the Tour de France.},

abstract = {The most efficient pedaling rate (lowest oxygen consumption) at a workload of 50-300 W has been reported to be in the range of 42-60 rpm. By contrast, most competitive cyclists prefer a pedaling rate of more than 90 rpm. The reason for this difference is still unknown. We assume that the high pedaling rate preferred by cyclists can be explained by the inherent properties of muscle fibers. To obtain statements which do not depend on muscle's cross-section and length, we generalized Hill's characteristic equations where muscle force and heat liberation are related to shortening velocity. A pedaling rate of f$\eta$max yields to maximal efficiency whereas the higher pedaling rate fPmax leads to maximal power. The ratio fPmax f$\eta$max between these two pedaling rates ranges from 1.7 to 2.4, and it depends on the muscle's fiber-type composition. In sprints and competitions of very short duration, fPmax is more advantageous because energy supply is not the predominant limiting factor. The price to be paid for the most powerful pedaling rate is lower efficiency and higher energy cost. In longer exercises, economy is more important and the optimal pedaling rate shifts toward f$\eta$max. We conclude that the optimal pedaling rate, representing the fastest race performance, is not fixed but depends on race duration; it ranges between f$\eta$max and fPmax. Our results are not only of interest for competitive cyclists but also for investigations using cycle ergometers: maximum power might not be reached by using a pedaling rate near the most efficient one. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

Five trained bicycle racers performed five progressive maximal tests on the ergometer. Each rode at pedal rates of 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 rev{\textperiodcentered}min-1. Oxygen uptake and heart rate were determined from each test and plotted against pedal rate for power outputs of 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 W. Both {Mathematical expression}and heart rate differed significantly among pedal rates at equivalent power outputs, the variation following a parabolic curve. The low point in the curve was taken as the optimal pedal rate; i.e., the pedal rate which elicited the lowest heart rate or {Mathematical expression}for a given power output. When the optimum was plotted against power output the variation was linear. These results indicate that an optimum pedal rate exists in this group of cyclists. This optimum pedal rate increases with power output, and when our study is compared to studies in which elite racers, or non-racers were used, the optimum seems to increase with the skill of the rider. {\textcopyright} 1985 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {This study investigated the change in the energetically optimal cadence after prolonged cycling. The energetically optimal cadence (EOC) was determined in 14 experienced cyclists by pulmonary gas exchange at six different cadences (100-50 rpm at 10 rpm intervals). The determination of the EOC was repeated after a prolonged cycling exercise of 55 min duration, where cadence was fixed either at high (>95 rpm) or low (<55 rpm) pedalling rates. The EOC decreased after prolonged cycling exercise at a high as well as at a low fixed cadence (P<0.01). According to the generalized muscle equations of Hill, this indicates that most likely more type I muscle fibres contribute to muscular power output after fatiguing cycling exercise compared to cycling in the beginning of an exercise bout. We suggest that the determination of EOC might be a potential non-invasive method to detect the qualitative changes in activated muscle fibres, which needs further investigation. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2010.},

abstract = {To determine the effects of differing pedal frequencies on V̇O2 and work output values at the lactate threshold (LT), fixed blood lactate concentrations of 2 mM and 4 mM (2 mM, 4 mM), and at max, nine male competitive road racing cyclists (USCF category I or II) completed three V̇O2 max tests, on a Monark bicycle ergometer, at pedal frequencies at 60, 90, and 120 repm. Each stage was 3 min in duration, starting to 0 kgm/min with subsequent stages increased by either 180 kgm/min (60 and 120 rpm) or 178 kgm/min (90 rpm). Blood samples were taken during the last 30 s of each stage. V̇O2 and work output at LT, 2 mM, and 4 mM were determined from individual blood lactate-work rate and V̇O2-work rate relationships. V̇O2 max and maximal work output were chosen as the peak values observed during the V̇O2 max tests. Results indicated that work output at LT, 2 mM, and 4 mM was affected by choice of pedal frequency (1278, 1140, 999 kgm/min at LT; 1533, 1450, 1182 kgm/min at 2 mM; 1780, 1703, 1487 kgm/min at 4 mM; for 60, 90, and 120 rpm, respectively, p < 0.05). Max work output at 60 and 90 rpm was significantly greater (P < 0.05) than at 120 rpm (2035, 2053, 1879 kgm/min for 60, 90, and 120 rpm, respectively. V̇O2 values at LT, 2 mM and 4 mM and max were also affected by pedal rate (41.31, 37.20, 39.99 ml/kg{\textperiodcentered}min-1 for V̇O2 at LT; 49.70, 45.44, 44.82 ml/kg{\textperiodcentered}min-1 for V̇O2 at 2 mM; 56.79, 51.51, 52.13 ml/kg{\textperiodcentered}min-1 for V̇O2 at 4 mM; 65.06, 61.28, 61.73 ml/kg{\textperiodcentered}min-1 for V̇O2 max; with 60, 90, and 120 rpm, respectively, P < 0.05). It was concluded that, in competitive cyclists, use of 60 rpm may be superior to 90 or 120 rpm for laboratory assessment of V̇O2 values at LT, 2 mM, 4 mM, and max; and for work output values at LT, 2 mM, and 4 mM.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between cadence and oxygen consumption with exercise duration. Ten triathletes who trained regularly were examined. The first test was always a maximal test to determine maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max). The other sessions were composed of six submaximal tests representing 80% of the maximal power reached with V̇O2max (P(max)). During these tests submaximal rides with a duration of 30 min were performed. Each test represented, in a randomised order, one of the following pedal rates: 50, 65, 80, 95, 110 rpm and a freely-chosen rate. V̇O2, respiratory parameters, and heart rate were monitored continuously. Two periods, between the 3rd and the 6th minute and between the 25th and the 28th minute, were analysed. Results showed that when V̇O2 and heart rate were plotted against cadence, each curve could be best described by a parabolic function, whatever the period. Furthermore, a significant effect of period was found on energetically optimal cadence (70±4.5 vs. 86±6.2 rpm, P < 0.05). Only during the second period was no significant difference found between freely-chosen cadence (83±6.9 rpm) and energetically optimal cadence (P > 0.05). In conclusion, our results suggest that during prolonged exercise triathletes choose a cadence that is close to the energetically optimal cadence. A change of muscle fibre recruitment pattern with exercise duration and cadence would explain the shift in energetically optimal rate towards a higher pedal rate observed at the end of exercise.},

abstract = {This investigation was undertaken to determine the effect of pedal frequency on submaximal exercise responses. Seven well-trained competitive cyclists were studied riding their road-racing bicycles on a motor-driven treadmill at 80% of maximum O2 consumption (V̇O2(max)) using different gear ratios. Cyclists were also studied during a series of unloaded trials to assess the effects of varying rates of limb movements independent of external work load. Heart rate (HR) increased, whereas net HR (after subtracting the HR during unloaded cycling) decreased with increasing pedal frequency during loaded cycling. Expiratory flow (V̇E), O2 consumption (V̇O2), blood lactate, net V̇O2 (after subtracting the V̇O2 of unloaded cycling), and net V̇E (after subtracting the V̇E during unloaded cycling) were quadratically related to pedal frequency. The quadratic relationships evident after corrections were made for the additional work needed to move the legs more frequently may be explained at the lower pedaling rates by a less uniform pattern of blood flow caused by increasing the force requirement per pedal stroke and, at the higher pedal frequencies, by the recruitment of additional musculature to stabilize the trunk. The average preferred frequency for the group, which was also the most economical pedaling rate judged by most of the variables, was 91 rpm, although the preferred pedaling rate for each subject ranged from 72 to 102 rpm.},

One open issue is the preferred cadence of trained cyclists while hill climbing. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the affect of cycling position on economy and preferred cadence in trained cyclists while they climbed a moderate grade hill at various power outputs. Eight trained cyclists (25.8 ± 7.2 years, V̇O2max 68.8 ± 5.0 ml kg-1 min-1, peak power 407.6 ± 69.0 W) completed a seated and standing hill climb at approximately 50, 65 and 75% of peak power output (PPO) in the order shown, although cycling position was randomized, i.e., half the cyclists stood or remained seat on their first trial at each power output. Cyclists also performed a maximal trial unrestricted by position. Heart rate, power output, and cadence were measured continuously with a power tap; ventilation V̇e, BF and cadence were significantly higher with seated climbing at all intensities; there were no other physiological differences between the climbing positions. These data support the premise that trained cyclists are equally economical using high or low cadences, but may face a limit to benefits gained with increasing cadence. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2006.},

Exercise intensities were administered in random order, separated by rest periods of 3-5 min; four pedalling frequencies (60, 80, 100 and 120 rpm) were randomly tested per intensity. The oxygen cost of cycling was always lower when the exercise was performed at 60 rpm. At each exercise intensity, VO2 showed a parabolic dependence on pedalling rate (r = 0.99-l: all P < 0.01) with a curvature that flattened as intensity increased. Likewise, the relationship between power output and gross efficiency (GE) was also best fitted to a parabola (r = 0.94-l, all P < 0.05). Regardless of pedalling rate, GE improved with increasing exercise intensity (P < 0.001). Conversely, GE worsened with pedalling rate (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the effect of pedalling cadence on GE decreased as a linear function of power output (r = 0.98, n = 6, P < 0.001). Similar delta efficiency (DE) values were obtained regardless of pedalling rate (21.5 (0.8); 22.3 (1.2), 22.6 (0.6) and 73.9 (1.0)%, for the 60; 80, 100 and 120 rpm, mean (SEM) respectively]. However, in contrast to GE, DE increased as a linear function of pedalling rate (r = 0.98, P < 0.05). The rate at which pulmonary ventilation increased was accentuated for the highest pedalling rate (P < 0.05), even after accounting for differences in exercise intensity and VO2 (P < 0.05). Pedalling rate per se did not have any influence on heart rate which, in turn, increased linearly with VO2. These results may help us to understand why competitive cyclists often pedal at cadences of 90-105 rpm to sustain a high power output during prolonged exercise.},

abstract = {Purpose: The present study investigates the effect of cadence on joint specific power and oxygenation and local muscle oxygen consumption in the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis in addition to the relationship between joint specific power and local muscle oxygen consumption (mVO2). Methods: Seventeen recreationally active cyclists performed 6 stages of constant load cycling using cadences of 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 and 110 rpm. Joint specific power was calculated using inverse dynamics and mVO2 and oxygenation were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: Increasing cadence led to increased knee joint power and decreased hip joint power while the ankle joint was unaffected. Increasing cadence also led to an increased deoxygenation in both the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis. Vastus lateralis mVO2 increased when cadence was increased. No effect of cadence was found for vastus medialis mVO2. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a different effect of cadence on the mVO2 of the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis. The combined mVO2 of the vastus lateralis and medialis showed a linear increase with increasing knee joint specific power, demonstrating that the muscles combined related to power generated over the joint.},

abstract = {Purpose The physiological consequences of freely chosen cadence during cycling remains poorly understood. We sought to determine the effect of cadence on the respiratory and hemodynamic response to cycling exercise. Methods Eleven cyclists (10 males, 1 female; age, 27 ± 6 yr; VO2max = 60.8 ± 3.7 mL{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1) completed four, 6-min constant-load cycling trials at 10% below their previously determined gas exchange threshold (i.e., 63% ± 5% peak power) while pedaling at 60, 90, and 120 rpm, and a freely chosen cadence (94.3 ± 6.9 rpm) in randomized order. Standard cardiorespiratory parameters were measured and an esophageal electrode balloon catheter was used to assess electromyography of the diaphragm (EMGdi) and the work of breathing (Wb). Leg blood flow index (BFI) was determined on four muscles using near-infrared spectroscopy with indocyanine green dye injections. Results Oxygen uptake (VO2) increased as a function of increasing cadence (all pairwise comparisons, P < 0.05). The EMGdi and Wb were significantly greater at 120 rpm compared with all other conditions (all P < 0.01). Vastus medialis and semitendinosus BFI were significantly greater at 120 rpm compared with 60 and 90 rpm (all P < 0.05). Gastrocnemius BFI was higher at 120 rpm compared with all other cadences (all P < 0.01). No difference in BFI was found in the vastus lateralis (P = 0.06). Blood flow index was significantly correlated with the increase in VO2 with increasing cadence in the medial gastrocnemius (P < 0.001) and approached significance in the vastus lateralis (P = 0.09), vastus medialis (P = 0.06), and semitendinosus (P = 0.09). There was no effect of cadence on Borg 0-10 breathing or leg discomfort ratings (P > 0.05). Conclusions High cadence cycling at submaximal exercise intensities is metabolically inefficient and increases EMGdi, Wb, and leg muscle blood flow relative to slower cadences.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of maximal strength capacity on muscle activation, during cycling, at three selected cadences: a low cadence (50 rpm), a high cadence (110 rpm) and the freely chosen cadence (FCC). Two groups of trained cyclists were selected on the basis of the different maximal isokinetic voluntary contraction values (MVCi) of their lower extremity muscles as follow: Fmin (lower MVCi group) and Fmax (higher MVCi group). All subjects performed three 4-min cycling exercises at a power output corresponding to 80% of the ventilatory threshold under the three cadences. Neuromuscular activity of vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (BF) was studied quantitatively (integrated electromyography, IEMG) and qualitatively (timing of muscle bursts during crank cycle). Cadence effects were observed on the EMG activity of VL muscle and on the burst onset of the BF, VL and RF muscles. A greater normalized EMG activity of VL muscle was observed for the Fmin group than the Fmax group at all cadences (respectively Fmin vs. Fmax at 50 rpm: 17 ± 5% vs. 38 ± 6%, FCC: 22 ± 7% vs. 44 ± 5% and 110 rpm: 21 ± 6% vs. 45 ± 6%). At FCC and 110 rpm, the burst onset of BF and RF muscles of the Fmax group started earlier in the crank cycle than the Fmin group These results indicate that in addition to the cadence, the maximal strength capacity influences the lower extremity muscular activity during cycling. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This review presents information that is useful to athletes, coaches and exercise scientists in the adoption of exercise protocols, prescription of training regimens and creation of research designs. Part 2 focuses on the factors that affect cycling performance. Among those factors, aerodynamic resistance is the major resistance force the racing cyclist must overcome. This challenge can be dealt with through equipment technological modifications and body position configuration adjustments. To successfully achieve efficient transfer of power from the body to the drive train of the bicycle the major concern is bicycle configuration and cycling body position. Peak power output appears to be highly correlated with cycling success. Likewise, gear ratio and pedalling cadence directly influence cycling economy/efficiency. Knowledge of muscle recruitment throughout the crank cycle has important implications for training and body position adjustments while climbing. A review of pacing models suggests that while there appears to be some evidence in favour of one technique over another, there remains the need for further field research to validate the findings. Nevertheless, performance modelling has important implications for the establishment of performance standards and consequent recommendations for training.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study investigated the effects of a combined endurance and strength training on the physiological and neuromuscular parameters during a 2-h cycling test. Methods: Fourteen triathletes were assigned to an endurance-strength training group and an endurance-only training group. They performed three experimental trials before and after training: an incremental cycling test to exhaustion, a maximal concentric lower-limbs strength measurement and a 2-h cycling exercise. Physiological parameters, free cycling chosen cadence and the EMG of Vastus Lateralis (VL) and Rectus Femoris (RF) were analysed during the 2-h cycling task before and after a strength training programme of 5 weeks (three times per week). Results: The results showed that the maximum strength and the isometric maximal voluntary contraction (isoMVC) after training were significantly higher (P < 0.01) and lower (P < 0.01) than those before training, respectively, in endurance-strength training group and endurance-only group. The physiological variables measured during the cycling tests and the progressive increase (P < 0.01) in EMGi(VL) and EMGi(RF) throughout the 2-h cycling test did not differ between the two groups before and after training, except for the variation of EMGi(VL) over the cycle time which was stabilized during the second hour of the 2-h cycling test due to training in endurance-strength training group. The decrease in free cycling chosen cadence observed in pre-training (P < 0.01) was also replaced by a steady free cycling chosen cadence for the endurance-strength training group during the second hour of exercise. Conclusion: This study confirmed the decrease in the free cycling chosen cadence with exercise duration and demonstrated that a specific combined endurance and strength training can prevent this decrease during a 2-h constant cycling exercise. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

@article{Seabury1977b,
abstract = {After review of previous studies, it seemed desirable to investigate further the interrelationships between pedalling rate, power output, and energy expenditure, using bicycle ergometry as a model for recreational bicycling. Three young adult male subjects rode a Monark ergometer at eight pedalling rates (30-120 rev min and four power outputs (‘ 0 ' 81-7. 163-4. and 1961 W) [vdot] determinations were made, and using measured R, gross energy expenditure was derived. When these values were combined with the results of other researchers using similar protocol but different power outputs, it was found that: (I) a ‘ most efficient' pedalling rate exists for each power output studied: (2) the (most efficient) pedalling rate increases with power output from 42 rev min at 40-8 W to 62 rev min at 326-8 W: and (3) the increase in energy expenditure observed when pedalling slower than‘ most efficient' is more pronounced at high power outputs than at low outputs, while the increase in response to pedalling faster than “lsquo; most efficient' is less pronounced at high power outputs than at low outputs. Thus, there is appreciable interaction between pedalling rate and power output in achieving the ‘ most efficient ' rate in bicycle ergometry. The ‘ most efficient' pedalling rate observed at high power outputs in the present study is considerably lower than that reported for racing cyclists by others. This discrepancy may well be related to the difference in swing weights between the ergomeler' s heavy steel flywheel and crankset, and that of the lightweight wheel and crankset used on racing bicycles. {\textcopyright} 1977 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Eighteen cyclists participated in this study. Each subject completed three sessions. The initial session was to evaluate the maximal isokinetic voluntary contraction level of lower limb. The second session was an incremental test to exhaustion. During the third session subjects performed a constant cycling exercise (20 min) conducted at five randomly cadences (50, 70, 90, 110 rpm) and at the preferred cadence (FCC) at the power reached at ventilatory threshold. Cardiorespiratory and EMG values were recorded. A metabolic optimum (EOC) was observed at 63.5 ± 7.8 rpm different from preferred cadence (FCC, 90.6 ± 9.1 rpm). No difference was found between FCC and the neuromuscular optimal cadence (NOC, 93.5 ± 4). Significant relationships were found between EOC, NOC and strength capacities (r = - 0.75 and - 0. 63), whereas FCC was only related with V̇O2max (r = 0.59).

Eight cyclists (C) and eight non-cyclists (NC) pedaled at 200 W under six randomly ordered cadence conditions (50, 65, 80, 95, 110 rpm and preferred cadence) on a Velodyne trainer. The VO2 responses of C and NC to cadence manipulation were similar. Both groups displayed lower VO2 values at lower cadences. VO2 differences between C and NC across cadences were not significant. Mean preferred pedaling cadence surprisingly was somewhat higher for NC (91.6 +/- 10.5 rpm) than C (85.2 +/- 9.2 rpm), but the difference was not significant. The most economical cadence was significantly lower for C (56.1 +/- 6.9 rpm) than NC (62.9 +/- 4.7 rpm). Thus, cycling experience did not substantially influence preferred cadence nor economy during moderate intensity cycling by highly fit athletes. We speculate that preferred cadence and economy similarities between C and NC are associated with similarities in the dynamic muscular training of the groups.},

abstract = {Eleven men with recreational bicycling experience rode a bicycle ergometer with instrumented force pedals to determine the effects of pedalling rate and power output on the total resultant pedal force, Far, and the component of the force perpendicular to the crank arm. The force patterns were obtained at power outputs of 100 W and 200 W for pedalling rates of 40–120 rpm in intervals of 10 rpm. Data were not obtained at 40 rpm at the 200 W power output. The Far, averaged over a crank cycle (Far) was lowest at 90 rpm and 100 W, a value statistically different (P < 0.05) from those at 40, 50, and 120 rpm. At 200 W, the Far was lowest at 100 rpm, a value statistically different (P < 0.05) from those at 50, 60, and 70 rpm. The Far varied widely (range of 30% of mean for all subjects) for individuals at a given power output.

abstract = {Intramuscular acidosis is a contributing factor to fatigue during high-intensity exercise. Many nutritional strategies aiming to increase intra- and extracellular buffering capacity have been investigated. Among these, supplementation of beta-alanine ($\sim$3–6.4 g/day for 4 weeks or longer), the rate-limiting factor to the intramuscular synthesis of carnosine (i.e. an intracellular buffer), has been shown to result in positive effects on exercise performance in which acidosis is a contributing factor to fatigue. Furthermore, sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate and sodium/calcium lactate supplementation have been employed in an attempt to increase the extracellular buffering capacity. Although all attempts have increased blood bicarbonate concentrations, evidence indicates that sodium bicarbonate (0.3 g/kg body mass) is the most effective in improving high-intensity exercise performance. The evidence supporting the ergogenic effects of sodium citrate and lactate remain weak. These nutritional strategies are not without side effects, as gastrointestinal distress is often associated with the effective doses of sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate and calcium lactate. Similarly, paresthesia (i.e. tingling sensation of the skin) is currently the only known side effect associated with beta-alanine supplementation, and it is caused by the acute elevation in plasma beta-alanine concentration after a single dose of beta-alanine. Finally, the co-supplementation of beta-alanine and sodium bicarbonate may result in additive ergogenic gains during high-intensity exercise, although studies are required to investigate this combination in a wide range of sports.},

The tests were preceded either by rest or unloaded cycling ("0" W). An early component of VE, VO2, and VCO2 responses, which was obscured on any single test by the breath-to-breath fluctuations, became apparent when the several repetitions were averaged. These early responses were abrupt when the work was instituted from rest but were much slower and smaller from the 0-W base line and corresponded to the phase of cardiodynamic gas exchange. Some 20 s after the onset of the work a further monoexponential increase to steady state occurred in all three variables, the time constants of which did not differ between the two types of test. Consequently, the exponential behavior of VE, VO2, and VCO2 in response to moderate exercise is best described by a model that incorporates only the second phase of the response.},

abstract = {CO2 is generated when lactate is increased during exercise because its [H'] is buffered primarily by HCO: (22 ml for each meq of lactic acid). We developed a method to detect the anaerobic threshold (AT), using computerized regression analysis of the slopes of the CO, uptake (ko,) vs. 0, uptake (VO,) plot, which detects the beginning of the excess CO, output generated from the buffering of [H'], termed the V-slope method. From incremental exercise tests on 10 subjects, the point of excess CO, output (AT) predicted closely the lactate and HCO: thresholds. The mean gas exchange AT was found to correspond to a small increment of lactate above the mathematically defined lactate threshold [0.50 t 0.34 (SD) meq/l] and not to differ significantly from the estimated HCO: threshold. The mean VO, at AT computed by the V-slope analysis did not differ significantly from the mean value determined by a panel of six experienced reviewers using traditional visual methods, but the AT could be more reliably determined by the V-slope method. The respiratory compensation point, detected separately by examining the minute ventilation vs. VCO$\sim$ plot, was consistently higher than the AT (2.51 t 0.42 vs. 1.83 t 0.30 l/min of VOW). This method for determining the AT has significant advantages over others that depend on regular breathing pattern and respiratory chemosensitivity.},

Aspects of pH regulation in human skeletal muscle have been studied with various techniques from analysis of membrane proteins, microdialysis, and the nuclear magnetic resonance technique to exercise experiments including blood sampling and muscle biopsies. The present review characterizes the cellular buffering system as well as the most important membrane transport systems involved (Na+/H+ exchange, Na-bicarbonate co-transport and lactate/H+ co-transport) and describes the contribution of each transport system in pH regulation at rest and during muscle activity. It is reported that the mechanisms involved in pH regulation can undergo adaptational changes in association with physical activity and that these changes are of functional importance. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Author.},

abstract = {Abstract The muscle glycogen content of the quadriceps femoris muscle was determined in 9 healthy subjects with the aid of the needle biopsy technique. The glycogen content could be varied in the individual subjects by instituting different diets after exhaustion of the glycogen store by hard exercise. Thus, the glycogen content after a fat ± protein (P) and a carbohydrate-rich (C) diet varied maximally from 0.6 g/100g muscle to 4.7 g. In all subjects, the glycogen content after the C diet was higher than the normal range for muscle glycogen, determined after the mixed (M) diet. After each diet period, the subjects worked on a bicycle ergometer at a work load corresponding to 75 per cent of their maximal O2 uptake, to complete exhaustion. The average work time was 59, 126 and 189 min after diets P, M and C, and a good correlation was noted between work time and the initial muscle glycogen content. The total carbohydrate utilization during the work periods (54?798 g) was well correlated to the decrease in glycogen content. It is therefore concluded that the glycogen content of the working muscle is a determinant for the capacity to perform long-term heavy exercise. Moreover, it has been shown that the glycogen content and, consequently, the long-term work capacity can be appreciably varied by instituting different diets after glycogen depletion.},

abstract = {The quadriceps femoris muscles of seven men were electrically stimulated under  extended anaerobic conditions to quantitate anaerobic energy release and the contribution of the glycolytic system to total ATP production. Muscles were intermittently stimulated 64 times at 20 Hz while leg blood flow was occluded. Each contraction lasted 1.6 s and was followed by 1.6 s of rest. The total contraction time was 102.4 s. Muscle biopsies were taken at rest and following 16, 32, 48, and 64 contractions. The ATP turnover rates during the four 16-contraction periods were 6.12, 2.56, 2.17, and 0.64 mmol X kg dry muscle-1 X s-1 contraction time. Glycolysis provided 58%, phosphocreatine 40% and a decreased ATP store 2% of the consumed energy during the initial 16 contractions. Glycolysis was responsible for 90% of the total ATP production beyond contraction 16. Absolute glycolytic ATP production decreased to 60, 55, and 17% of the amount in the initial 16 contractions during the final three periods, respectively. In conclusion glycolysis produced approximately 195 mmol ATP/kg dry muscle during the initial 48 contractions (76.8 s) and only approximately 15 mmol ATP/kg dry muscle during the final 16 contractions. Equivalent values for total ATP turnover were 278 and 16.5 mmol/kg dry muscle.},

abstract = {Eight male subjects volunteered to take part in this study. The exercise protocol consisted of ten 6-s maximal sprints with 30 s of recovery between each sprint on a cycle ergometer. Needle biopsy samples were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle before and after the first sprint and 10 s before and immediately after the tenth sprint. The energy required to sustain the high mean power output (MPO) that was generated over the first 6-s sprint (870.0 +/- 159.2 W) was provided by an equal contribution from phosphocreatine (PCr) degradation and anaerobic glycolysis. Indeed, within the first 6-s bout of maximal exercise PCr concentration had fallen by 57% and muscle lactate concentration had increased to 28.6 mmol/kg dry wt, confirming significant glycolytic activity. However, in the tenth sprint there was no change in muscle lactate concentration even though MPO was reduced only to 73% of that generated in the first sprint. This reduced glycogenolysis occurred despite the high plasma epinephrine concentration of 5.1 +/- 1.5 nmol/l after sprint 9. In face of a considerable reduction in the contribution of anaerobic glycogenolysis to ATP production, it was suggested that, during the last sprint, power output was supported by energy that was mainly derived from PCr degradation and an increased aerobic metabolism.},

abstract = {The time course for the activation of glycogen phosphorylase (Phos) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and their allosteric regulators was determined in human skeletal muscle during repeated bouts of maximal exercise. Six subjects completed three 30-s bouts of maximal isokinetic cycling separated by 4-min recovery periods. Muscle biopsies were taken at rest and at 6, 15, and 30 s of exercise during bouts 1 and 3. Phos was rapidly activated within the first 6 s of bout 1 from 12% at rest to 47% at 6 s. The activation of PDH increased from 14% at rest to 48% at 6 s and 95% at 15 s of bout 1. Phos reverted back to basal values at the end of the first bout, whereas PDH remained fully activated. In contrast, in the third bout, PDH was 42% at rest and was activated more rapidly and was nearly completely activated by 6 s, whereas Phos remained at basal levels (range 1420%). Lactate accumulation was marked in the first bout and increased progressively from 2.7 to 76.1 mmol/kg dry wt with no further increase in bout 3. Glycogen utilization was also marked in the first bout and was negligible in bout 3. The rapid activation of Phos and slower activation of PDH in bout 1 was probably due to Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Lactate accumulation appeared to be due to an imbalance of the relative activities of Phos and PDH. The increase in H+ concentration may have served to reduce pyruvate production by inhibiting Phos transformation and may have simultaneously activated PDH in the third bout such that there was a better matching between pyruvate production and oxidation and minimal lactate accumulation. As each bout progressed and with successive bouts, there was a decreasing ability to stimulate substrate phosphorylation through phosphocreatine hydrolysis and glycolysis and a shift toward greater reliance on oxidative phosphorylation.},

abstract = {The continual supply of ATP to the fundamental cellular processes that underpin skeletal muscle contraction during exercise is essential for sports performance in events lasting seconds to several hours. Because the muscle stores of ATP are small, metabolic pathways must be activated to maintain the required rates of ATP resynthesis. These pathways include phosphocreatine and muscle glycogen breakdown, thus enabling substrate-level phosphorylation (‘anaerobic') and oxidative phosphorylation by using reducing equivalents from carbohydrate and fat metabolism (‘aerobic'). The relative contribution of these metabolic pathways is primarily determined by the intensity and duration of exercise. For most events at the Olympics, carbohydrate is the primary fuel for anaerobic and aerobic metabolism. Here, we provide an overview of exercise metabolism and the key regulatory mechanisms ensuring that ATP resynthesis is closely matched to the ATP demand of exercise. We also summarize various interventions that target muscle metabolism for ergogenic benefit in athletic events.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine the muscle metabolic changes occurring during intense and prolonged, heavy-resistance exercise. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis of 9 strength trained athletes before and 30 s after an exercise regimen comprising 5 sets each of front squats, back squats, leg presses and knee extensions using barbell or variable resistance machines. Each set was executed until muscle failure, which occurred within 6-12 muscle contractions. The exercise: rest ratio was approximately 1:2 and the total performance time was 30 min. Concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine phosphate (CP), creatine, glycogen, glucose, glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P), $\alpha$-glycerophosphate ($\alpha$-G-P) and lactate were determined on freeze-dried tissue samples using fluorometric assays. Blood samples were analyzed for lactate and glucose. The exercise produced significant reductions in ATP (p<0.01) and CP (p<0.001), while $\alpha$-G-P more than doubled (p<0.05), glucose increased tenfold (p<0.001) and G-6-P fourfold (p<0.001). Muscle lactate concentration at cessation of exercise averaged 17.3 mmol {\textperiodcentered} kg-1 w.w. Glycogen concentration decreased (p<0.001) from 160 to 118 mmol {\textperiodcentered} kg-1 w. w. It is concluded that high intensity, heavy resistance exercise is associated with a high rate of energy utilization through phosphagen breakdown and activation of glycogenolysis. {\textcopyright} 1986 Springer-Verlag.},
